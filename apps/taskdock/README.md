# TaskDock

**TaskDock** is an agentic task orchestration and worktree management system for multi-agent
workflows. It provides a unified CLI for managing tasks, locks, worktrees, validation, merges, and
observability—designed to be both human- and AI-agent-friendly.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize TaskDock in your repo
taskdock init

# Get next available task
taskdock next

# Create worktree for a task
taskdock worktree create PROJ-0017

# Validate your work
taskdock validate

# Merge when done
taskdock merge --current
```

## Features

- **Task Intake**: Atomic lock-based task selection with dependency resolution
- **Worktree Management**: Isolated development environments per task
- **Validation Pipeline**: Consistent format/type/lint/test across mono and single repos
- **Git Integration**: Provider-aware merge automation (GitHub/Azure DevOps)
- **Health Monitoring**: Lock cleanup, status dashboards, and observability
- **Telemetry**: Correlation IDs and structured JSON logging for agent debugging
- **Config Hierarchy**: Layered defaults → user → repo → env → CLI flags
- **Concurrency Safety**: flock-based protection for multi-agent workflows
