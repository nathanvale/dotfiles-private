/**
 * Issue #81 — runtime contract drift check for Issue-to-PR v2 operator docs.
 *
 * This module compares claims made in the operator-facing docs (command
 * names, contract slice names, packet roles, and `data.*` response field
 * paths) against the live CLI surface, so docs drift is caught mechanically
 * instead of by review eyeballing.
 *
 * Batch 1: the **contract-fact loader**. It reads the authoritative contract
 * facts from the running CLI subprocess — never by importing CLI internals or
 * duplicating any value as a literal.
 *
 * Batch 2 (added below `loadContractFacts`): the **doc-claim extractor**.
 * `extractDocClaims()` parses ONE scoped doc's text and reports the
 * contract-token claims it makes (route ids, command names, slice names,
 * packet roles, scaffold ids, `data.*` field paths, and scoped
 * recovery/control-plane links) using bounded patterns over prose and fenced
 * code blocks. It holds no expected contract VALUES of its own (AC5): it only
 * reads structural markers and emits what the doc says, leaving the comparison
 * to later batches. Later batches add the comparator and the orchestrator.
 *
 * Design law (AC5): this file holds NO literal route ids, slice names,
 * packet roles, or field paths as expected values. The only contract
 * *coordinates* it knows are which CLI fields to read (the help payload's
 * `commands`, `contract_slices`, `state_response_shape`,
 * `diagnose_response_shape`, `scaffold_ids`, and the `data.` path prefix docs
 * use). Those are read-locations, not duplicated contract values.
 *
 * Design law (AC6): read-only. The loader only invokes the read-only CLI
 * commands (`--help`, `contract <slice>`). It never writes files, touches
 * git, or mutates ledger state. A failed subprocess, a non-ok envelope, OR a
 * well-formed `ok` envelope carrying an EMPTY fact set (empty arrays / empty
 * response shapes) is a hard error: an empty / partial fact set would mask
 * drift or make every doc claim look like drift, so we throw instead.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scope boundary (AC8) — what this check DELIBERATELY does NOT do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module is a narrow contract-drift check, NOT a broad docs auditor. The
 * boundary below is intentional; a future maintainer must NOT extend it into a
 * general prose/consistency linter without re-opening the scope decision.
 *
 *  - Main SCOPE is `SCOPED_DOCS`. It does NOT validate other Issue-to-PR
 *    references (stage-*.md, host-adapters.md, etc.). Narrow add-ons also
 *    cross-check ledger schema-slice pointers, runtime scaffold generated
 *    blocks, hidden pointer compatibility, and visible scaffold commands.
 *  - It checks ONLY the contract-token kinds from AC1-AC4: route ids, `cli.ts`
 *    command names, `contract <slice>` names, packet roles (ONLY in explicit
 *    `cli.ts packet <role>` command positions), `data.*` response-field paths,
 *    and the scoped recovery/control-plane links (the first-run-gotchas
 *    relationship). The ledger add-on checks emitted schema-slice pointers in
 *    the ledger helper reference.
 *    It does NOT judge prose truth, broad docs consistency, or any token kind
 *    beyond these.
 *  - It adds NO external dependency and generates NO docs. Runtime contract
 *    checks only read live CLI or renderer facts.
 *  - It does NOT validate decompose.ts flags
 *    (`decompose.ts --validate-ledger-batches` yields no command claim),
 *    route-precedence ORDER, enum-value prose (`committed`, `needs-revision`),
 *    template filenames (`builder-dispatch.md`), or role-ish workflow words in
 *    PROSE ("the Builder", "a validator") OUTSIDE explicit `cli.ts packet
 *    <role>` positions. The extractor is scoped by structural POSITION, not by
 *    token shape, precisely so these stay out of scope.

 * use structurally identical bullets (`- \`X\`: ...`), so token SHAPE cannot
 * tell a real route id from a conceptual subroute name. Section CONTEXT can.
 *
 * Two context layers, scanned line by line:
 *  - **Tag layer** (authoritative): an XML-style `<route_catalog>` opener
 *    turns route context ON until its `</route_catalog>` (or any other
 *    `<section>` tag) closes it. Any OTHER `<tag>` opener (e.g.

 *    "Stage 4 subroutes". Bold sub-labels inside a tag region (e.g.
 *    `**Happy path**`) do not flip context — the enclosing tag wins.
 *  - **Heading layer** (fallback, only when NOT inside any tag region): a
 *    markdown heading or bold-only label whose text matches `/route/i` opens
 *    route context; the next heading/bold that does NOT match closes it. This
 *    keeps tag-less docs (and small fixtures) working off a "routes" heading.
