# Stage 2: plan reference

**Contract owner:** this reference owns Stage 2 planning handoff,
plan-path checkpointing, and the `/ce-plan` addendum trigger.

**Read trigger:** open this reference when Stage 1 has committed the AC
checkpoint and the orchestrator is about to invoke `/ce-plan`, or when
resuming a Stage 2 turn before the plan file has been recorded in
`frontmatter.plan_path`. See also:
[ledger-and-helper.md](ledger-and-helper.md),
[stage-3-decompose.md](stage-3-decompose.md),
[`templates/ce-plan-addendum.md`](../templates/ce-plan-addendum.md).

## Inputs

Confirmed AC list in the ledger's `## Acceptance criteria` section (from
Stage 1).

## Actions

1. Invoke `/ce-plan` at the top level of this orchestrator session in
   Issue-to-PR pipeline planning posture. The planner produces the plan
   artifact and structured Implementation Units, then returns control to this
   runbook. Pass it:
   - the issue title + body;
   - the ledger's `## Acceptance criteria` section as the canonical AC list;
   - the structured-output addendum body — render it deterministically
     with `cli.ts packet ce-plan --json` (returns the reusable addendum
     verbatim — see [`templates/ce-plan-addendum.md`](../templates/ce-plan-addendum.md)
     for the rendered shape) and append it after the issue body and AC
     list;
   - this posture instruction: "Issue-to-PR pipeline planning posture: write
     the plan and structured unit YAML only; skip post-generation menus,
     deepening prompts, implementation offers, and separate review flows;
     return the plan path."
2. `/ce-plan` writes its plan document to
   `docs/plans/<date>-<NNN>-feat-<slug>-plan.md` per its own conventions.
3. **Verify the plan file exists at the path ce-plan reported.** If `/ce-plan`
   reported success but no file is present, re-invoke once. If still no file,
   fail-stop with `blocked_reason: ce-plan-no-output`.
4. Record the plan path in ledger frontmatter as `plan_path`.
5. Compute and persist `plan_digest`: run
   `decompose.ts --plan-digest <plan-path>` and write the returned value to
   frontmatter in this same checkpoint. This is the Stage 2 digest the Stage 1
   reference defers here (`batch_contract_digest` stays null until Stage 3).
   Persisting `plan_digest` now while `batch_contract_digest` is still null is
   safe: the derived `digests` confirmation axis stays `pending` until all
   three digests are non-null, so it does not flip to `stale` or block routing
   to `decompose`. The CLI is read-only per ADR 0002; the orchestrator writes
   the digest field.
6. Rename the feature branch from `feat/issue-{issue-number}-pending` to
   `feat/issue-{issue-number}-<slug-from-plan-title>`.
7. Commit the ledger (plan path and `plan_digest` recorded) and the plan file
   before transitioning to Stage 3:
   `chore(issue-{issue-number}): record plan path`.

## Exit condition

Plan file exists at the path recorded in `frontmatter.plan_path`; `plan_digest`
is set and matches the plan file; branch renamed; ledger and plan file
committed; working tree clean.

## Failure modes

- ce-plan asks clarifying questions → forward to user; do not auto-answer.
- ce-plan produces a plan with zero Implementation Units → fail-stop, ask user
  to expand the issue or supply more context.
  `status: blocked`, `blocked_reason: no-implementation-units`.
