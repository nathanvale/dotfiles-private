# Issue to PR (v2 install — human index)

Maintainer-facing index for the v2 install at
`runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/`.

This README is a **finder**, not a workflow manual. Agents enter through
the skill control plane at
[`../../skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md`](../../skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md).
That skill points to this runbook tree for installed assets, per-stage
references, and packet templates. Operators and maintainers read this
file only to land on the right artifact. Every detail below is a pointer;
the linked artifact owns the prose.

## Installed path

The v2 tree is installed via symlink at
`~/.claude/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/`, which resolves through
`~/.claude/runbooks → ${REPO}/runbooks` (managed by `./setup sync`). Once a
ledger exists, `cli.ts state <ledger-path> --json` reports
`installed_artifact_presence.all_present` so the orchestrator can fail
closed on a partial install; the U6 contract for that envelope lives in
[`references/host-adapters.md`](references/host-adapters.md#install-artifact-presence-u6).

## Invocation

Primary invocation is the manual skill:

```text
/issue-to-pr <issue-number> [target-repo]
```

The skill owns the host-neutral durable-state loop and decides when to
load the hot router, references, templates, and helpers. Claude Code
drivers such as `/goal` and `/loop` are host-adapter details documented
in the skill, not the core workflow authority.

### Claude Code drivers

`/goal` (Claude Code v2.1.139+) remains the preferred autonomous driver
for Claude Code when the skill host adapter chooses to use one; `/loop`
is the fallback for older harnesses or fixed-cadence ticks. The shared
runbook-area README at
[`docs/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2-refactor/README.md`](../../docs/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2-refactor/README.md#driver-goal-vs-loop)
owns the comparison table; do not restate it here.

## Per-issue ledger

Each run writes a per-issue ledger in the target repo at
`docs/runbooks/issue-to-pr/issue-{issue-number}-ledger.md`. The path is
the stable per-issue ledger convention. First turn renders the starting
document with `cli.ts ledger-init --json`; the orchestrator writes the
returned `ledger_markdown` payload. Ledger schema, frontmatter fields, and the
runbook-version skew table all live in
[`references/ledger-and-helper.md`](references/ledger-and-helper.md).

## File map

The artifacts a maintainer needs to find, in this order:

1. **`../../skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md`** - the public skill control
   plane. Owns host-neutral invocation, durable-state loop, gates,
   route map, stage shells, review loop, and success criteria.
2. **`issue-to-pr.md`** - the v2 hot-router support file. Keeps the
   historical installed runbook prose and compatibility details while
   the skill acts as the public control plane.
3. **`cli.ts`** - the v2 read-only fact emitter (U4/U5/U6). One
   sentence per command:
   - `state` - emit the ledger's durable state for the skill or support
     hot router to route from.
   - `next` - emit the minimal next route id as a fact.
   - `contract` - emit a runtime contract slice from the CLI catalog.
   - `diagnose` - emit a richer diagnostic envelope than `state` for
     debugging drift, version skew, and install presence.
   - `packet` - render a dispatch-role packet from `templates/` and
     ledger state.
   - `scaffold` - render a runtime-owned scaffold view by id, including
     candidate-batch, Builder return-envelope, and Validator evidence views.
   - `ledger-init` - render the initial per-issue ledger body for Stage 1.

   Every command requires `--json` and writes one envelope to stdout.
   The CLI is a fact emitter and never says "run X" (ADR 0002). For the
   full envelope contract run
   `bun ~/.claude/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/cli.ts --help --json`.
4. **`decompose.ts`** - the deterministic helper for plan parsing,
   digest computation, AC coverage, findings validation, and
   patch-proposal validation. Command families:
   - **Plan parsing** - parses an authored plan and emits a candidate
     batch DAG.
   - **Digest computation** - recomputes the plan, AC, and
     batch-contract digests recorded in ledger frontmatter.
   - **Validation** - pure checks for ledger batches, AC coverage,
     findings shape, open-finding closure gates, and confirmation
     state; each exits non-zero on a violation.
   - **Patch proposal** - validates a candidate patch-batch against
     existing ledger context.

   Run `bun ~/.claude/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/decompose.ts` with no
   arguments for the full flag listing; the helper enumerates its
   usage string in its error path.
5. **`contract-drift.ts`** - the read-only drift check for operator
   docs against the live CLI contract. It also reads live ledger schema
   slices and requires `ledger-and-helper.md` to point at the emitted
   slice commands.
6. **`lib/`** - implementation modules behind `cli.ts` and
   `decompose.ts`. One-line role per module:
   - `contract.ts` - runtime contract constants shared across the CLI
     and helper surfaces.
   - `cli-envelope.ts` - envelope shape and emitters used by `cli.ts`.
   - `cli-diagnostics.ts` - LogTape diagnostics, AsyncLocalStorage
     correlation, and redactor used by the CLI surface.
   - `ledger.ts` - ledger reader/parser and helper command bodies.
   - `digest.ts` - canonical hashing for the three stored digests.
   - `validate.ts` - shared validation predicates used by the CLI and
     helper.
   - `route.ts` - route classification and install-topology walk.
   - `packets.ts` - packet rendering against `templates/`.

   The public API of each module lives in the module itself; this
   README does not restate it.
7. **`references/`** - per-stage prose. The read trigger for each file
   lives in its own header. The skill's reference-loading policy and the
   support hot router name which file to open for each route id. Files
   in this directory:
   `stage-1-pick-issue.md`, `stage-2-plan.md`, `stage-3-decompose.md`,
   `stage-4-batch-loop.md`, `stage-5-final-review.md`,
   `stage-6-ship.md`, `builder-dispatch.md`,
   `findings-and-validators.md`, `host-adapters.md`,
   `ledger-and-helper.md`, `regression-matrix.md`.
8. **`templates/`** - packet templates rendered by `cli.ts packet`.
   Files: `builder-work-packet.md`, `builder-return-envelope.md`,
   `proposer-envelope.md`, `validator-envelope.md`,
   `patch-proposal.md`, `ce-plan-addendum.md`. The role each template
   serves is encoded in its filename; the validator persona model lives
   in
   [`references/findings-and-validators.md`](references/findings-and-validators.md).

## Helper execution context

Helpers are pure, read-only, and **must run from the target repo root**.
The full rule — including why running from an installed path or home
directory validates against the wrong git repository — lives in
[`references/ledger-and-helper.md#helper-execution-context`](references/ledger-and-helper.md#helper-execution-context).

- Use the MCP runners (`bun_runTests`, `tsc_check`, `biome_lintCheck`)
  where they fit; shell fallback is allowed when they don't. The
  resolution order lives in
  [`references/stage-6-ship.md`](references/stage-6-ship.md).

## Compatibility notes

- **v2 owns the runnable contract.** The `issue-to-pr` skill is the
  active public entrypoint; this tree owns helper behavior, routing,
  references, templates, and drift checks.
- **Ledger path is stable across the cutover.** See [Per-issue
  ledger](#per-issue-ledger) above. Version-skew rules live in
  [`references/ledger-and-helper.md`](references/ledger-and-helper.md).
- **Current workflow contract version.** New v2 ledgers declare
  `runbook_version: "3"`. Version-skew behavior and continuation
  evidence live in
  [`references/ledger-and-helper.md`](references/ledger-and-helper.md#runbook-version-skew-u6);
  `contract-drift.ts` keeps the docs and runtime lifecycle fields
  aligned after versioned contract changes.

## What this area deliberately does not do

This README is a finder. The owning artifact for each topic:

- **Builder dispatch policy** lives in
  [`references/builder-dispatch.md`](references/builder-dispatch.md).
- **Turn protocol** lives in the skill control plane at
  [`../../skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md`](../../skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md);
  the v2 hot router at [`issue-to-pr.md`](issue-to-pr.md) remains the
  compatibility/support reference.
- **Fix protocol** lives in
  [`references/findings-and-validators.md`](references/findings-and-validators.md).
- **Risk classification** lives in
  [`references/findings-and-validators.md`](references/findings-and-validators.md).
- **Ledger schema** lives in
  [`references/ledger-and-helper.md`](references/ledger-and-helper.md);
  initial ledger rendering lives in `cli.ts ledger-init --json`.
- **Glossary terms** live in each owning artifact (no central
  glossary).
- **Persona selector and broad-reviewer fallback** live in
  [`references/findings-and-validators.md`](references/findings-and-validators.md).
- **Host-readiness and Builder infrastructure failure modes** live in
  [`references/host-adapters.md`](references/host-adapters.md).
- **Per-stage detail** (pick-issue, plan, decompose, batch-loop,
  final-review, ship) lives in the matching
  `references/stage-*-*.md` file.
