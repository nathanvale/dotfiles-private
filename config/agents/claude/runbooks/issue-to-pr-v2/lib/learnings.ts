/**
 * Workflow Learnings registry: parse + schema validation (issue #90, AC2).
 *
 * The registry is a human-readable Markdown doc with a SINGLE fenced yaml
 * block (`references/workflow-learnings-registry.md`, scaffolded by the
 * `registry-file` batch). This module reads that block, parses it, and
 * validates each learning entry against the closed schema fixed by PRD #88
 * and documented in the registry reference.
 *
 * This module is the full helper surface for the registry: `parseRegistry`
 * (single-block extraction + parse), `parseRegistryFromString` (in-memory
 * variant used by the dispatcher re-validate gate), `validateRegistry`
 * (required fields + the four closed enums + evidence-key whitelist on stored
 * entries), `loadCandidate` (JSON / YAML by extension), `validateCandidate`
 * (candidate shape, enum membership, evidence-key whitelist, identifying-field
 * presence for stable signature derivation), `signatureFor` (explicit
 * signature or sha256 over identifying fields), `upsert` (pure-function
 * signature dedupe, evidence append, lifecycle update, canonical-overwrite
 * protection), `serializeRegistry` (prose-preserving Markdown writer over a
 * constrained block-style YAML emitter), and `assertRegistryWriteTarget`
 * (repo-root-anchored write-scope guard plus a narrow tmpdir-escape for tests).
 *
 * Enum constants follow the `lib/contract.ts` style: an `as const` array as
 * the single source of truth, with a derived union type. They are exported so
 * the dispatcher and tests validate against the same closed sets.

/**
 * Refuse any write target outside the registry surface this helper owns
 * (issue #90, AC5).
 *
 * Returns void on accept; throws an actionable `Error` (naming the rejected

 * (`learnings-registry.ts`) calls this AFTER candidate validation and BEFORE
 * `writeFileSync` so a wrong target fails loudly without ever modifying disk;
 * candidate/registry validation errors still surface first because they are
 * more actionable for the operator.
 *
 * The previous repair (b6bbeb0) traded a denylist for a TAIL-MATCH allowlist,
 * which closed F42 but reintroduced two adjacent gaps the adversarial reviewer
 * surfaced as F48 + F49:
 *
 *   - F49 (foreign-tail-match-no-repo-containment): tail-matching alone
 *     accepts ANY absolute path that happens to end with the canonical
 *     relative path — e.g. `/Users/attacker/runbooks/.../registry.md`,
 *     `/etc/runbooks/.../registry.md`, or a staged decoy directory. A caller
 *     in a wrong cwd / stale worktree / adversarial cwd would then write
 *     outside the real repo.
 *
 *   - F48 (f42-tmpdir-escape-still-accepts-arbitrary-md-files): the
 *     tmpdir-escape accepted ANY `.md` leaf under `os.tmpdir()` as long as
 *     no tripwire fired (`/tmp/i_just_pwned_you.md`, `/tmp/README.md`...).
 *
 * The fix is REPO-ROOT ANCHORING + a much tighter tmpdir-escape contract:
 *
 * 1. Empty-string / non-string and any `..` traversal segment are refused
 *    at the top (unchanged from the prior repair).
 *
 * 2. Compute the CANONICAL ABSOLUTE PATH = `${repoRoot}/${canonicalRelative}`.
 *    The repo root is resolved once (cached) via `git rev-parse
 *    --show-toplevel` (mirroring the spawnSync pattern in `decompose.ts`),
 *    with a `package.json`-walk fallback when git is unavailable. If neither
 *    works, the helper throws an unrecoverable error: it cannot run safely
 *    without knowing where the canonical write target actually lives.
 *
 * 3. PRODUCTION accept rule: the candidate's resolved absolute path
 *    (`realpathSync` on the existing ancestor + tail) equals the canonical
 *    absolute path. Compared CASE-INSENSITIVELY so macOS APFS does not
 *    bypass the gate by case-flipping. F49 closes here: a foreign
 *    `/Users/attacker/.../registry.md` does not match the real repo root,
 *    so it is refused.
 *
 * 4. TMPDIR-ESCAPE (preserved narrowly for test infrastructure): when the
 *    resolved candidate is under the realpathSync'd `os.tmpdir()`, accept
 *    ONLY when the leaf filename matches one of two narrow shapes
 *    (case-insensitive):
 *      - `registry.md`  (used by `lib/learnings.test.ts`'s `writeRegistry`
 *        helper for the prior-batch dispatcher tests), or
 *      - `workflow-learnings-registry.md`  (used by this file's
 *        `makeCanonicalRegistry` for the canonical-tail dispatcher tests).
 *    AND none of the AC5 tripwires fires (a `skills/` segment
 *    case-insensitive, an `issue-*-ledger.md` filename, or any
 *    SOURCE_EXTENSIONS extension). AND the leaf is not bare `.md`. AND the
 *    leaf does not contain control characters. F48 closes here: a
 *    `/tmp/i_just_pwned_you.md` is not one of the two allowed leaves so it
 *    is refused even though it sits under tmpdir.
 *
 * 5. ELSE refuse with an actionable error that names the rejected target,
 *    the canonical allowed absolute path, and the underlying reason so the
 *    operator can self-correct.
 *
 * The case-insensitive comparisons (and case-insensitive tripwires) keep F40
 * closed on case-insensitive filesystems. The expanded SOURCE_EXTENSIONS set
 * keeps F41 closed. The allowlist (rather than a denylist) keeps F42 closed
 * for repo-relative paths.
