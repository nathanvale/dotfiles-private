# Prompt Smoke Runner

## Purpose

Run instruction-topology health checks and smoke tests, then return a structured pass/fail summary.

## Checks

Run these in order:

### 1. Instruction Health

```bash
./scripts/agent-instructions.sh check
```

This validates startup budgets, owner routes, leakage, appendices, and agent-runtime delivery drift.

### 2. Smoke Tests (when requested)

```bash
bun scripts/multi-agent-smoke.ts
```

This validates startup propagation expectations and shared-vs-harness-specific behavioral boundaries.
For Codex, the smoke command disables MCP server startup so instruction-only checks spend less time booting unrelated runtime services.

The smoke runner already uses harness-aware warning and timeout defaults. Use `--warn-after-ms` or `--timeout-ms` only when you need to override that policy for one run.

Only run smoke tests when the caller explicitly requests them. Never infer a smoke run from startup, shared-behavior, or propagation changes. If unsure, run only the health check.

To run a subset:
```bash
bun scripts/multi-agent-smoke.ts --tests boundary,propagation
```

## Output

Report:
- **health-check:** PASS or FAIL with the first failing check name
- **smoke-tests:** PASS, FAIL (with failing test and mismatch), or SKIPPED
- **summary:** one-line overall verdict

Keep the output minimal. The caller needs pass/fail and the smallest useful failure detail, not the full script output.
