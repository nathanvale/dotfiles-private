// material may appear on them, mechanically checkable with sentinel values.
//
// This module is PURE (no I/O, no clock, no process control): it owns the
// sensitive-run marker lifecycle and the sentinel scanner. Actual capture
// suppression, the fenced lease, quarantine markers, and the signed XPC
// delivery helper are platform/native concerns named in R17 and owned by
// `runtime/browser-use-security/`; this guard is the mechanically-provable
// containment gate the CLI attaches to a run and asserts before releasing
// any governed surface. The delivery helper and the disposable `op` helper
// are the ONLY components that ever observe raw bytes (R16); this guard never
// receives them either — it registers the sentinels the harness sweeps for.
