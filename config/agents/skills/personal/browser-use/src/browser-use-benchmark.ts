// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AE12 token-efficiency benchmark harness (release contract R26).
//
// R26: "Agent Browser token-efficiency claims must be supported by repeatable
// same-task measurements of model-visible tokens, wall time, command count, and
// artifact volume."
//
// This module owns the PURE measurement core: given one BenchmarkSample per
// eligible lane (the verbatim caller-visible JSON envelope the CLI returned, the
// wall time, the command count, and the run receipt's artifacts), it computes
// the four AE12 axes and renders a neutral comparison table. It holds NO
// assumption that any lane is cheaper — it only reports measured numbers and
// labels the cheapest axis after the fact.
//
// The live driver (runBenchmarkTask / main) shells the real
// `browser-use task run` front door once per eligible lane against its OWN
// Verified Handoff Envelope, so the numbers come from the same code-owned
// contract a caller uses. A single verified handoff attaches exactly one adapter
// (R11), so a genuine two-lane AE12/R26 comparison needs one handoff per lane
// (repeatable `--handoff`); each lane runs against the handoff whose attachment
// matches it. When no proof-passing Warm Chrome handoff is available for a lane,
// the driver records the gate rather than fabricating a lane result. One handoff
// is the degenerate case: exactly one lane is measured, the rest are gated, and
// no cross-lane comparison is licensed.
//
// Model-visible token proxy: the AE12 contract measures "model-visible tokens".
// A caller (Codex or Claude Code) only ever reads the CLI's JSON result
// envelope — never the raw browser trace, which the shared-run receipt keeps out
// of caller sight by design. So the proxy is the UTF-8 byte length of that
// envelope; token count is approximated as bytes/4 (a stable, model-agnostic
// proxy, explicitly labelled as an approximation).
