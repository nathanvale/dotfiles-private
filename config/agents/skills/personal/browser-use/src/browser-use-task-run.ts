// Wave-2 task run routing engine (release contract R6-R11, R23; flows F1, F7).
//
// The PURE routing core of the `browser-use task run` front door: given a Task
// Intent, the composed Adapter Lane Registry, an optional explicit lane
// override, and the adapter the Verified Handoff Envelope attached, it selects
// exactly one admissible lane or returns one typed refusal. No I/O, no clock,
// no browser call — the driver (browser-use.ts) owns store writes, handoff
// reads, and live dispatch; this module owns the routing decision so it stays
// unit-testable and the driver stays thin (agent-native seam discipline).
//
// R6: selection weighs requested outcome (the intent's preferred lane), required
// capabilities, implementation integrity, and lane evidence.
// R10: an explicit override STILL passes the same capability + evidence +
// integrity admission; an inadmissible route fails with a repair action.
// R11: no implicit adapter switch — a handoff that names a different adapter
// than the selected lane fails closed rather than substituting a lane.
