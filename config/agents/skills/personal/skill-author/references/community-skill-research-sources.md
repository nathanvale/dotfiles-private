# Community Skill Research Sources

Use this source note before changing community-skill rules reached from `references/skill-design-decision-runbook.md`.

Keep accepted rules in the owning `skill-author` reference. Keep source freshness here.

  - Checked: 2026-06-09 with QMD.
  - Discovery only; read the full source before using for gotchas sections, refinement evidence loops, progressive disclosure, skill telemetry, or model-aware gotcha notes.
- Local QMD recall hit: `qmd://vault/docs/research/2026-03-18-claude-code-skills-best-practices.md`
  - Checked: 2026-06-09 with QMD.
  - Discovery only; read the full source before using for skill folder shape, gotchas, description triggers, stored skill memory, helper scripts, config pattern, or on-demand hooks.
