# One Password

Scoped vocabulary for safe 1Password / op secret access: service-account paths, secret reference mappings, and the compatibility-surface escape hatch. Glossary only.

## Language

**one-password**:
The canonical adapted skill for safe 1Password CLI (`op`) workflows. It owns the generic `op` safety contract, while exact vault, item, field, and service-account details belong in service-specific owning skills.
_Avoid_: 1password, onepassword, secrets

**Reference-only env file**:
An env-shaped file whose values are 1Password secret references such as `op://...`, not plaintext secret values. It is a safe mapping artifact that may be reviewed or regenerated when every secret-bearing value remains a reference.
_Avoid_: pointer env file, map file, `.env` with secrets

**Secret reference mapping**:
A capability-owned declaration that maps a tool-facing environment variable or config key to a 1Password secret reference. The capability that consumes the secret owns the mapping; `one-password` owns only the safety contract.
_Avoid_: central secret manifest, global env bucket, one-password mapping

**Scoped service-account access**:
The preferred non-interactive 1Password access path for agents. A service account token may act as the bootstrap secret only when its vault and item permissions are scoped to the capability's declared secret reference mappings.
_Avoid_: broad service account, ambient 1Password access, desktop-first auth

**Token-scoped vault authority**:
The service account's effective vault grant is the access authority for a capability. A capability that requires one dedicated vault fails when the token exposes zero or multiple vaults; it does not duplicate access policy in a local vault allowlist.
_Avoid_: shadow vault allowlist, automatic cross-vault search, locally widened access

**Persistent shell session**:
A stable shell context reused for an interactive 1Password task so sign-in, verification, and follow-up commands share session state. Tmux is the usual CLI implementation; Codex desktop may use a persistent Codex PTY or start a dedicated tmux session.
_Avoid_: tmux-only rule, fresh shell per `op` command, scattered sign-in

**Direct service-account read**:
A narrow, non-interactive 1Password read that uses scoped service-account access without relying on desktop sign-in state. It runs as a plain single command when the capability supplies the exact vault, item, field, and expected shape; unattended reads never route through tmux or a persistent PTY, which exist only to preserve interactive sign-in state.
_Avoid_: ambient read, probing read, service-account enumeration, tmux-wrapped unattended read

**Per-command token injection**:
The custody rule that a service-account token reaches `op` only for the single command that needs it, supplied by a managed source such as a keychain-backed or 1Password-backed wrapper, or an owning runtime's helper. The token is never parked in profile files, shell rc, `.env` files, exported ambient env, or tmux/PTY environment.
_Avoid_: profile-exported token, ambient token, session-wide export, token in shell history

**Targeted metadata check**:
A 1Password metadata command against an exact account, vault, item, or field already declared by an owning capability. It may prove existence or shape, but must not discover candidates by listing broad accounts, vaults, or items.
_Avoid_: broad enumeration, vault discovery, item discovery

**Vault-scoped discovery**:
A metadata-only search within the vault scope granted to a capability's service account, used when the capability knows the token-scoped vault but not yet the exact item. Candidate Login items require the approved origin; an optional login path may rank or disambiguate same-origin candidates after query and fragment removal. A unique deterministic match may bind automatically; ambiguity requires human selection. Title and field shape are hints only.
_Avoid_: account-wide enumeration, cross-vault search, secret-value scan, ambiguous automatic binding

**Materialized secret adapter**:
A generated compatibility surface that contains plaintext secret values only because a target tool cannot consume `op run` or 1Password references directly. It is never the source of truth and should be scoped to the tool that needs it.
_Avoid_: secret source, canonical env file, synced secrets file

## Example Dialogue

Dev: "Should `one-password` include the exact npm token item name?"
Domain expert: "No. `one-password` defines the safe `op` workflow. The npm-owning skill supplies the exact item and field names."

Dev: "Can an agent regenerate the env file?"
Domain expert: "It can regenerate a reference-only env file. If a tool needs plaintext values, that output is a materialized secret adapter and must stay generated, scoped, and non-canonical."

Dev: "Where should the `OPENAI_API_KEY=op://...` mapping live?"
Domain expert: "With the capability that needs OpenAI. `one-password` defines safe access, not the global list of every secret."

Dev: "Should an agent unlock the desktop app first?"
Domain expert: "No. Prefer scoped service-account access for declared mappings. Desktop app integration is the fallback when scoped access is unavailable or insufficient."

Dev: "Does `one-password` literally require tmux in Codex desktop?"
Domain expert: "No. It requires a persistent shell session for interactive 1Password work. Tmux is the common CLI implementation, but a persistent Codex PTY can satisfy the same session-state boundary."

Dev: "Can a service-account read run outside tmux?"
Domain expert: "It must. Unattended service-account reads never route through tmux or a persistent PTY; those sessions exist only to preserve interactive desktop sign-in state."

Dev: "Can the agent export the service-account token from `~/.profile`?"
Domain expert: "No. Per-command token injection is the custody rule: a managed source supplies the token for the one command that needs it, and it never lives in profile files or ambient env."

Dev: "Can an agent list vaults to find the right one?"
Domain expert: "It cannot enumerate the whole account. A capability may use Vault-scoped discovery inside the service account's granted vault and automatically bind one deterministic match; ambiguity requires human selection."
