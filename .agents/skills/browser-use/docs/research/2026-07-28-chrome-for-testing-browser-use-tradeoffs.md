# Chrome for Testing Trade-offs for Browser Use

## Question

Can Chrome for Testing support authenticated, persistent Browser Use, and does
the existing binary-specific ban follow from browser capability?

## Bottom Line

- Chrome for Testing is a Chrome flavor built for testing and automation.
- It is versioned, downloadable, integrated with Chrome releases, and does not
  auto-update.
- Chrome supports reusable custom profiles through `--user-data-dir`.
- No reviewed official source says Chrome for Testing disables website
  authentication.
- Persistent authentication depends on reusing the same profile rather than on
  the Chrome distribution alone.
- Browser-level Google account Sync was not established by this research.
- The current Browser Use runtime still rejects Chrome for Testing. This note
  records evidence and options; it does not change that policy.

## Documented Facts

### Chrome for Testing

Google describes Chrome for Testing as:

- A dedicated Chrome flavor for web testing and automation.
- A versioned binary without auto-update.
- Built and uploaded with Chrome releases across Stable, Beta, Dev, and Canary.
- As close to regular Chrome as possible without harming the testing use case.
- Available with correspondingly versioned ChromeDriver binaries and JSON
  version-discovery endpoints.

### Profiles and attachment

ChromeDriver documentation says:

- Its default is a new temporary profile for each session.
- `--user-data-dir` selects a custom profile.
- Chrome creates the profile when the path does not exist.
- The same profile can be modified and used again in future sessions.
- `debuggerAddress` attaches to an existing Chrome debugging server.

Context7 returned the same custom-profile and CDP-attachment documentation. It
returned no Chrome-for-Testing-specific authentication restriction.

### Known caveat signal

An open Chrome for Testing repository issue reports extension preferences not
surviving replacement with a newly obtained Chrome version despite profile
arguments. This is one user report, not a confirmed general browser invariant.
Treat extension-state continuity across CfT upgrades as an acceptance-test
obligation.

## Inferences

- Website authentication should work in Chrome for Testing because it retains
  ordinary Chrome web capabilities and can use a persistent profile.
- Auth continuity should be proven with the exact binary, profile, adapter, and
  target application used by Browser Use.
- A new binary download and a new profile are separate operations. Downloading
  CfT does not itself define whether later runs reuse or replace a profile.
- The browser binary name is weaker safety evidence than headed mode, profile
  persistence, profile ownership, endpoint locality, and verified attachment.

These are architectural inferences from the documented capabilities. They are
not vendor guarantees.

## Pros

- Exact version pinning and reproducible reruns.
- No surprise update between automation runs.
- Official Stable, Beta, Dev, and Canary artifacts.
- Matching ChromeDriver availability.
- Isolation from the everyday Chrome installation.
- Suitable for a dedicated persistent agent profile.
- Clear binary acquisition and provenance surface.

## Cons

- No automatic security updates; Browser Use would own an explicit upgrade
  policy and staleness checks.
- Additional download, storage, provenance, cleanup, and platform support.
- Profile and extension compatibility must be tested across version upgrades.
- Product identity differs from the installed consumer Chrome application.
- Existing-session CDP attachment can expose fewer ChromeDriver operations than
  a session ChromeDriver launched itself. This is an attachment-mode limitation,
  not a Chrome-for-Testing-only limitation.
- Human takeover and browser-level Google account features need explicit proof.

## Browser Use Options

### Keep the current ban

Benefit:

- One browser identity and one operational path.

Cost:

- Rejects a browser designed for deterministic automation even when it could
  satisfy the same profile and endpoint safety properties.

### Add an explicit Chrome for Testing lane

Candidate acceptance contract:

- Explicit browser class; never an automatic fallback.
- Headed mode.
- Dedicated persistent profile.
- Owner-only profile permissions.
- Numeric-loopback CDP.
- Verified binary, profile, listener, and endpoint consistency.
- Exact CfT version and explicit upgrade path.
- Authentication continuity proof against a representative target.
- Profile and extension migration proof before version changes.

This keeps Warm Chrome proof-first while moving browser eligibility from a
product-name rule toward a capability contract.

## Research Result

The evidence does not justify saying Chrome for Testing cannot authenticate.
It justifies saying Browser Use has not yet accepted or proven Chrome for
Testing as a supported warm-browser class.

## Accepted Direction

On 2026-07-28, Nathan accepted an explicit capability-proven Chrome for Testing
lane. The current rejection stays in force until implementation and acceptance
proof pass. Chrome for Testing remains forbidden as an automatic fallback.
