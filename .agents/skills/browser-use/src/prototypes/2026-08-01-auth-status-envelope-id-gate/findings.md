# Spike receipt — auth status envelope id-gate fix (2026-08-01)

Lane: pre-build falsify (browser-free — CLI envelope validation, no CDP).
Branch: `fix/auth-status-envelope-id-gate`. Spike edits live in the working
tree of this branch; graduation is test-first re-application, not this diff.

## Bug under test

`browser-use auth status --json` (forbidden env keys stripped) crashes with
`CliRuntimeContractError` instead of emitting its typed blocked envelope.

Proven causal chain (corrects the handoff's premise — the trigger is NOT
prose interpolation into `error.message`):

1. Supervisor status → blocked `profile-policy-unproven`, continuation
   `create-credential-clean-profile`.
2. `emitAuthTokenLifecycleResult` builds the blocked envelope carrying that id
   in `runtime_actions[0].id` and `continuation.next_action_id`.
3. `runtime-envelope.ts` validates BOTH id fields with `validateNonEmptyString`,
   which runs `validateSafeRuntimeText` — the free-text VALUE vocabulary scan
   (`runtime-text-safety.ts` pattern label `credential`). The legal enum id
   fails → `CliRuntimeContractError` ("runtime_actions.0.id includes unsafe
   runtime-contract text: credential" + same for continuation).
4. That error propagates to `runBrowserUseCli`'s catch → `emitCliError`; its
   message quotes the label "credential"; `redactUnsafeText` (values-only:
   op:// URLs, sensitive --flags, paths) leaves it; `createCliRuntimeError`
   validates `error.message` → second `CliRuntimeContractError` thrown INSIDE
   the last-resort emitter → uncaught crash, exit 1.

## Q1 — id fields gated by SHAPE instead of vocabulary → typed envelope?

Candidate: `validateRuntimeActionIdText` (non-empty, ≤128 chars,
`/^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$/`) replacing `validateNonEmptyString` for
`runtime_actions[].id` and `continuation.next_action_id`. Ids are controlled
enum identifiers, not agent-facing prose; all 69 existing ids match the token
shape. Rationale mirrors the repo's own NAME-gate-vs-VALUE-scan split
(`runtime-text-safety.ts` env-var name gate comment).

**PASS (live):**
`env -u OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN -u OP_CONNECT_TOKEN -u OP_CONNECT_HOST -u BROWSER_USE_TOKEN -u BROWSER_USE_OP_TOKEN bun run browser-use auth status --json`
→ exit **20**, parseable typed envelope: `evaluation.status=blocked`,
`blocked_cause=profile-policy-unproven`, 4/5 checks ready,
`continuation.next_action_id=create-credential-clean-profile`, no stack trace.

**PASS (harness):** success envelope accepts the legal id; malformed ids
(`"Bearer abc"`, uppercase, spaces, punctuation, leading dash, >128 chars) all
still rejected.

## Q2 — can emitCliError still be crashed after Q1?

**CRASH CONFIRMED pre-hardening:** `runForTest(["auth","status","--json"])`
with `runAuthTokenSupervisor` throwing `Error("supervisor rejected the
credential material")` → `CliRuntimeContractError` escapes the emitter.
(Usage-error paths are already covered by `sanitizeUsageValue`; the live
vector is any upstream error message carrying banned vocabulary — including
any future `CliRuntimeContractError` whose issue text quotes a banned label.)

**PASS post-hardening:** `emitCliError` wraps `createCliRuntimeError` in
try/catch; on a leak-guard rejection it falls back to the generic message
"runtime error message withheld: it did not pass the runtime-contract text
safety gate." → exit 1, valid envelope, no crash. The last-resort emitter is
now total.

## Graduation decision

- Fix 1 (required for the objective): id-shape gate in
  `runtime/cli-command-facade/src/runtime-envelope.ts` for the two id fields.
  This IS a shared-facade change (handoff flagged it approval-gated) — but the
  evidence shows no app-level alternative meets the objective short of
  renaming the action id, which ripples into the Swift supervisor contract and
  the parallel session's prototype. Compatibility: all 69 audited current
  action ids remain valid; formerly accepted free-form ids with uppercase,
  whitespace, punctuation, or length >128 would now fail the shape gate (none
  exist in-repo). Other id-ish fields (choices[].id/action_id,
  constraints[].id, forbidden_action_ids) still use the vocabulary scan —
  flagged as a consistency follow-up, not taken here.
- Fix 2 (defense-in-depth, app-level): emitCliError never-throw fallback.
- Test homes: facade envelope validation suite (id acceptance/rejection) +
  browser-use auth command test (blocked profile-policy → typed envelope) +
  emitCliError fallback test via runForTest with a throwing supervisor.
