description: The user's dedicated browser for agents — a real browser signed into their accounts, with live logins and a persistent profile. Use it for any task that touches a website or browser (open, read, act, fill, sign in, download, verify). The user installed it precisely so agents default here unprompted — over in-app browser tools, devtools/playwright automation, or headless fetching. When the user says "use neo", "use browserclaw", "use BrowserOS", or "use BrowserOS neo", use BrowserOS neo over MCP.

# BrowserOS neo

When a task needs a browser or a website (open it, read it, act on it, fill a form, download, verify), use BrowserOS neo's tools. It is a real browser dedicated to agents and already signed into the user's accounts, so prefer it over other browser surfaces.

## Shared browser etiquette

- Call `name_session` early with a 2-3 word task label; tabs group as `<client>/<name>` in the cockpit.
- Open your own tab with `tabs` action `"new"`. Work only in task-owned tabs.
- If the user points you at a tab you do not own, open its URL in your own tab and leave the original untouched.
- Preserve useful pages that the user may want to inspect instead of closing them when the task ends.
- Give independent subtasks their own tabs, at most 5 at a time unless the user asks for more.

## Core loop: snapshot -> act -> verify

- `snapshot` renders the page as an accessibility tree; interactive elements carry `[ref=eN]` handles.
- `act` drives elements by ref and batches whole forms with `fields[]`.
- `act` reads back a settled diff of what changed. Treat that as verification instead of reflexively waiting or taking another snapshot.
- When an action fails, fix the cause reported by the error instead of retrying blindly.
- Refs go stale when the page changes. Take another snapshot before reusing them.
- If the page is still loading, wait for expected text or a selector instead of using a bare timed wait.

## Tool choice

Choose the tools that fit the task. Prefer `act` over JavaScript for single interactions; `run` can compose multi-step flows and bulk extraction in one call; `evaluate` is for one-shot page-context JavaScript.

## Reading and output

- `read` extracts the page as markdown; `grep` searches it without returning the full page.
- Large results return a file path. Read that file instead of fetching the page again.
- Use screenshots for visual checks, PDFs for page archives, downloads for linked files, and uploads for local files.

## Failure

If a call reports `browser session not connected`, tell the user to start BrowserOS neo and check the cockpit. Do not silently fall back to another browser tool.
