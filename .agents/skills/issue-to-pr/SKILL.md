# /issue-to-pr

<objective>
Drive one GitHub issue to PR via Issue-to-PR v2 per-issue ledger. This skill is the host-neutral control plane — owns: orchestration loop, host adapters, routing gates, reference loading, stage shells, review loop, success criteria.

Deterministic mechanics → `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/cli.ts` + `decompose.ts`. Handoff payloads → `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/templates/`. Deep/rare stage detail → `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/`.
</objective>

<quick_start>

```
/issue-to-pr <issue-number> [target-repo]
```

- `<issue-number>` (required): GitHub issue number to drive
- `[target-repo]` (optional): `owner/repo`; defaults to current repo

Canonical ledger path in target repo:

```
docs/runbooks/issue-to-pr/issue-{issue-number}-ledger.md
```

On first turn: establish `{issue-number}`, `{target-repo}`, target repo root, ledger path, `{v2-cli}`. If `{target-repo}` provided, resolve/open it before helper commands. If the ledger exists, read it. Then run the v2 CLI from the target repo root as the first durable-state command.

`{v2-cli}` is the host-resolved path to `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/cli.ts` — repo-local in this checkout, or `~/.claude/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/cli.ts` in a Claude Code install.

```
bun {v2-cli} state docs/runbooks/issue-to-pr/issue-{issue-number}-ledger.md --json
```

Route only from emitted facts, not conversation memory.
</quick_start>

<host_adapters>

Workflow authority = this skill control plane + durable ledger. Host drivers only keep the loop running.

**Codex**

- Drive the loop directly in the current thread.
- Repo-local reads/edits from target repo root.
- Resolve `{v2-cli}` before first state command. This config repo: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/cli.ts`. Other target repos: prefer the installed runbook path for the active host.
- Do not depend on `/goal` or `/loop` for routing, convergence, or transcript evidence.

**Claude Code**

- Manual `/issue-to-pr <issue-number> [target-repo]` supported.
- For autonomous driving, `/goal` may point at: this skill control plane, target issue, target repo, canonical ledger path, installed v2 assets at `~/.claude/runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/`.
- `/loop` is a fixed-cadence fallback for older Claude Code harnesses.
- `/goal` and `/loop` do not own workflow policy — they re-enter this control plane and the ledger-driven loop.

**Autonomous-mode policy (active `/goal`, `/loop`, or `lfg`)**

Under an autonomous driver, the loop runs hands-off and does NOT pause for discretionary checkpoints. Distinction is by gate kind, not convenience:

- **Mandatory gates — always stop, even under a goal.** Designed human checkpoints + safety stops: Stage 1 AC confirmation, Stage 3 batch-contract confirmation (DAG, execution modes, digests), both Stage 4 decision gates (`change_first` investigation-required, `accepted-risk`), any `<fail_stops>` entry. Auto-confirming these defeats the workflow; an active goal never skips them.
- **Discretionary pauses — never stop under a goal; just proceed.** Do NOT ask "shall I proceed to Stage N?", "want me to run the next batch?", or "how should I drive the remaining batches?" between stages or subroutes. Under a goal these are noise: advance to the next `data.route_id` action and report inline. Surface a checkpoint only when it is a mandatory gate above.
- **Avoid self-inflicted permission prompts.** Prefer tool calls and git forms that do not trip permission/hook stops mid-run. To reconstruct a file's content, use `git diff <ref> -- <path> | git apply` (scoped to that path) rather than `git checkout <ref> -- <path>` or `git restore --source=<ref> <path>` (both commonly hook-blocked). Never use inline script-execution flags (Python `-c`, Node/Ruby `-e`, `sh -c '...'` / `bash -c '...'` one-liners) that may trip a permission/security prompt. A permission prompt for a genuinely-needed write is a harness-settings concern, not a reason to stop the goal — note it and continue once cleared.

</host_adapters>

<durable_state_contract>

Durable ledger state beats transcript memory. Every resumed turn routes from the v2 CLI state envelope, not conversation recall.

- Canonical ledger: target repo at `docs/runbooks/issue-to-pr/issue-{issue-number}-ledger.md`.
- Run helper commands from target repo root, even when `{v2-cli}` points to an installed path outside it.
- If the ledger does not exist, use the canonical path and let the state envelope route to ledger creation.
- `cli.ts state <ledger-path> --json` = first non-read operation on every resumed turn.
- Use emitted facts (`data.route_id`, `data.required_reference_ids`, `data.blocking_gates`, sibling gate fields) as orchestration inputs.
- Do not restate or hand-validate the ledger schema, route union, packet schema, or helper output contract in this skill — those deterministic contracts belong to the CLI, helper, templates, and runtime code.

</durable_state_contract>

<orchestration_loop>

Start every turn in this order:

1. Re-read this skill control plane.
2. Resolve `{issue-number}`, `{target-repo}`, target repo root, `{ledger-path}`, `{v2-cli}`.
3. Re-read the per-issue ledger if it exists.
4. Run `bun {v2-cli} state {ledger-path} --json` from target repo root as first non-read operation.
5. If `data.installed_artifact_presence.all_present` is false, stop before loading references.
6. Route from `data.route_id`. Unknown route IDs = findings against `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/lib/route.ts`, not prose routes.
7. Load every reference listed in `data.required_reference_ids`. Action templates load only when preparing that packet/handoff.
7b. When `data.route_id` begins with `blocked-`, also load `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/first-run-gotchas.md` on top of `data.required_reference_ids` before any blocked-route stop.
7c. When PR URL confirmation has happened on `data.route_id: ship`, or when a fail-stop exposes a workflow-level learning, load `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/workflow-learning-scan.md`.
8. Apply remaining pre-stage gates before entering a stage.
9. Execute exactly one visible workflow action: advance a stage, commit one lifecycle checkpoint, run one implementation attempt, record one implementation-attempt checkpoint, run one Validator wave, converge one batch, or fail-stop with a specific question.
10. Commit any required lifecycle checkpoint before turn-end when the stage requires durable state. Working tree must be committed + clean before any state-changing stage transition, not only at stages whose exit conditions restate it.
11. When the host evaluator needs transcript evidence, echo the ledger frontmatter, `## Batches`, `## Findings data`, and `## Findings` table — or an equivalent host-visible summary.

</orchestration_loop>

<pre_route_gates>

These gates re-fire on every turn after `cli.ts state --json` and before any Builder, Validator, Proposer, or ship work.

- Install presence fires before reference loading.
- Runbook version skew fires after blocked-route overlay loading so recovery context is present.

**Runbook version skew**

- If envelope reports `data.runbook_version_skew` missing/mismatched without continuation evidence, load the blocked-route overlay, then stop.
- Surface mismatch and load `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/ledger-and-helper.md` for continuation evidence shape.
- Use `first-run-gotchas.md` recipe 2.4 (`blocked-runbook-version-skew`) for symptom-first evidence.
- Do not auto-rewrite the ledger frontmatter version field.

**Installed artifact presence**

- If `data.installed_artifact_presence.all_present` is false, stop.
- Surface missing installed roots; ask operator to repair the v2 install or symlink before continuing.
- Sibling-field gate. Not necessarily a `data.blocking_gates` entry or blocked `route_id` — do not route from those fields alone.

Both gates must clear before entering stage work.

</pre_route_gates>

<reference_loading_policy>

Load references one level deep from this skill. `data.required_reference_ids`
is the turn-specific authority for files under
`runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/` — each ID is a reference filename.
Full route/reference map: `cli.ts contract route_required_references --json`.
Runtime source: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/lib/route.ts`.

- Load `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/{id}` for every emitted `data.required_reference_ids` entry.
- Preserve contract order; `route_required_references` uses `ordering: "catalog"`.
- Load action templates only when preparing that packet or handoff.
- Stage 2 planning template: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/templates/ce-plan-addendum.md`.
- Stage 4 Builder template: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/templates/builder-work-packet.md`.
- Stage 4 Validator template: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/templates/validator-envelope.md`.
- Stage 5 Proposer template: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/templates/proposer-envelope.md`.
- Stage 5 patch-batch template: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/templates/patch-proposal.md`.
- Stage 4 host readiness detail remains in `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/host-adapters.md`; load when emitted refs include it or when diagnosing host readiness.
- Router regression audit remains `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/regression-matrix.md`.

Do not copy packet schemas, ledger schema, route field tuples, or full hatch semantics into this skill.
If a route needs a reference that `data.required_reference_ids` does not name, file drift against `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/lib/route.ts` or packet renderer.

`first-run-gotchas.md` has a split trigger:
- On `blocked-` routes: **deterministically loaded by this skill's loop** (orchestration step 7b) while **absent from `data.required_reference_ids` by design**.
  `requiredReferenceIdsFor` does not return it for any route — intentional, not route.ts drift. Adding it to `requiredReferenceIdsFor` would still be wrong.
- On non-blocked but cryptic first-run states: **discretionary** — a recovery overlay the operator loads on judgment when a valid state is confusing.

Either way, the load is a skill-loop decision, not because `data.required_reference_ids` named it.

`workflow-learning-scan.md` has an attention trigger:
- Ship-time: load after PR URL confirmation and before the final shipped
  checkpoint.
- Fail-stop: load when the stop evidence reveals a workflow-level learning
  worth recording.

The scan remains outside `data.required_reference_ids` by design. On
fail-stops, record durable blocked state first when required, surface blocker
and resume condition, then consider scan evidence as part of the same visible
fail-stop action. Use the scan-owned Fail-Stop Scan contract for learning
judgment and output shape.

The scan records run metadata through the ledger and registry helper only. It
does not patch skills, runbooks, CLI code, docs, gotchas, deliverables, or
workflow contracts while shipping or recovering.

</reference_loading_policy>

<route_catalog>

`runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/lib/route.ts` is the runtime source of truth for route IDs. This catalog is an operator-facing map.

**Happy path**

- `no-ledger` and `pick-issue`: enter Stage 1.
- `plan`: enter Stage 2.
- `decompose`: enter Stage 3.
- `batch-loop`: enter Stage 4.
- `final-review`: enter Stage 5.
- `ship`: enter Stage 6.
- `shipped`: terminal; echo final ledger state and stop.

**Blocked routes**

- `blocked-frontmatter-blocked-reason`: surface recorded blocked reason; ask whether to unblock, abandon, or reframe.
- `blocked-runbook-version-skew`: use the version-skew gate above.
- `blocked-acceptance-criteria-stale`: return to Stage 1 AC re-confirmation; do not auto-rewrite ACs. See `first-run-gotchas.md` recipe 2.1.
- `blocked-stage-3`: return to Stage 3 plan or contract revision.
- `blocked-batch-contract-stale` and `blocked-digests-stale`: return to Stage 3 recompute + user confirmation. See `first-run-gotchas.md` recipes 2.2 + 2.3.

`first-run-gotchas.md` gives symptom-first CLI evidence recipes. On any `blocked-` route the loop loads it deterministically before blocked-route recovery. On valid-but-cryptic non-blocked first-run states, load on operator judgment.

Unknown route IDs = blocking findings against the runtime route contract. Do not invent prose-only routes.

</route_catalog>

<stage_shells>

Each stage shell is an entrypoint, not the full playbook. Load required references before taking the one visible action.

**Stage 1: issue and acceptance criteria**

- Inputs: `{issue-number}`, optional `{target-repo}`, target repo root, canonical ledger path.
- One visible action: create/resume the ledger and get user-confirmed acceptance criteria.
- Exit: ledger exists, ACs confirmed + committed, issue feature branch in place, tree clean, next state routes to `plan`.
- Stop: closed/blocked issue without override, user abort, unsafe branch, unresolved AC ambiguity.

**Stage 2: plan**

- Inputs: confirmed ACs, ledger path.
- One visible action: render the planning addendum, invoke planning, or persist the resulting `plan_path` checkpoint.
- Exit: `plan_path` is set, plan exists, feature branch renamed off its `-pending` placeholder, tree clean, next state routes to `decompose`.
- Stop: planning asks the user a question, no plan output after one retry, plan has no implementation units.

**Stage 3: decompose and confirm batch contract**

- Inputs: plan path, confirmed ACs, ledger path.
- One visible action: parse/validate the candidate DAG, run contract review, present the digest-backed batch contract for confirmation, or persist the confirmed `## Batches` checkpoint.
- Exit: batch contract confirmed, every batch starts pending, coverage + digests confirmed, tree clean, next state routes to `batch-loop`.
- Stop: parse error, cyclic DAG, uncovered AC, missing batch contract field, open Stage 3 P0/P1, contract-review cycle cap reached without convergence, stale digest, confirmation refusal.

**Stage 4: batch loop**

- Inputs: confirmed batch DAG, current findings state.
- One visible action: exactly one Stage 4 subroute below.
- Dispatch policy: `tdd`, `proof_first`, every repair after an open P0/P1, and every attempt on a patch-batch (`id: patch-NNN`, which carries an open final-review P0/P1 forward — never inline-eligible) MUST dispatch Builder. `change_first` MAY stay Orchestrator-inline only while bounded: ≤2 touched files, obvious, low-risk, non-behavioural, non-governance, non-public-contract, no broad discovery, no heavy Orchestrator context load, not the third consecutive inline attempt without user-confirmed exception. Falls back to Builder dispatch as soon as a dispatch trigger fires. The full always-on Validator wave runs on every committed implementation attempt regardless of path.
- Exit: every batch is `converged` or `accepted-risk`, no open P0/P1 blocks the batch loop, tree clean, next state routes to `final-review`.
- Stop: host readiness failure, Builder infrastructure failure, no eligible batch, escape hatch fire, iteration cap, user decision required.

Stage 4 subroutes:

- `select-eligible-batch`: choose one pending batch whose dependencies
  are terminal; if none qualifies, fail-stop with dependency evidence.
- `start-batch-checkpoint`: after host readiness passes, record the
  selected batch lifecycle start. This is separate from implementation
  work.
- `implementation-attempt`: run exactly one implementation attempt
  against the confirmed `batch.files` for the active batch. The umbrella
  has two paths; the dispatch policy above determines which path is
  legal for the active batch (it does not arbitrate between them on
  every turn):
  - `implementation-attempt-builder`: mandatory for `tdd`,
    `proof_first`, and any repair; required for `change_first` once a
    dispatch trigger fires. Render the Builder Work Packet and dispatch
    one Builder attempt.
  - `implementation-attempt-inline`: allowed only for bounded
    inline-eligible `change_first` attempts, and never for a patch-batch
    (`id: patch-NNN`), which is Builder-only on every attempt. The Orchestrator edits
    inline within the same authority boundary as Builder (edits only
    confirmed `batch.files`) and records the attempt as
    Orchestrator-inline evidence in its own audit lane on the ledger,
    separate from Builder attempt evidence.
- `attempt-checkpoint`: after a committed Builder or Orchestrator-inline
  implementation attempt and before Validator packet rendering, record the
  `implementation_attempt_checkpoint` Notes evidence tied to the commit and
  attempt lane. This is ledger-only evidence; it does not replace the
  Validator wave.
- `validator-wave`: hand Validators the committed implementation
  evidence and touched files after the matching attempt checkpoint exists.
  Validators own correctness findings; the Orchestrator records and
  normalizes them. The full always-on wave runs regardless of which
  implementation path produced the commit.
- `finding-repair`: dispatch a Builder repair for open P0/P1 findings
  in the active batch. Repairs are Builder-only; inline repair is never
  permitted, even after an inline initial attempt.
- `converge-batch`: run the no-open-P0/P1 gate and mark the batch
  terminal only when the ledger facts support convergence.
- `accepted-risk-or-reframe`: record a user-approved accepted risk or
  stop for reframe/replan when hatches or caps prevent convergence.

Only one Stage 4 subroute is the visible action per turn. Orchestrator routes + records lifecycle state. Implementation path (Builder dispatch or bounded Orchestrator-inline) owns one scoped attempt against `batch.files`. Validators own correctness findings. Proposer only appears when Stage 5 sends a final-review finding back as a patch-batch candidate.

**Stage 5: final review**

- Inputs: every batch terminal, clean tree.
- One visible action: run final review, record final findings, close non-blocking findings, or route one open P0/P1 through the Proposer/patch-batch handoff back to Stage 4.
- Exit: final findings terminal, `final_reviewed_at` set + committed, tree clean, next state routes to `ship`.
- Stop: reviewer coverage cannot cover correctness + testing, final review needs replan, patch-batch confirmation required.

**Stage 6: ship**

- Inputs: final review complete, clean tree, no open P0/P1.
- One visible action: run local checks, create/push the PR, run the read-only Workflow Learning Scan after PR URL confirmation, or persist the final shipped ledger checkpoint.
- Exit: `pr_url` is set, ledger status is `shipped`, tree clean, next state routes to `shipped`.
- Stop: local check failure, unsafe final metadata checkpoint, unsupported smoke-direct request, PR creation failure requiring operator input.

</stage_shells>

<fail_stops>

When a fail-stop fires: record durable state when the stage requires it, surface the smallest useful evidence to the user, name the resume condition.

If fail-stop evidence reveals a workflow-level learning, load
`runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/workflow-learning-scan.md`. The scan may
record ledger/registry metadata as part of the same visible fail-stop action.
Use the scan-owned Fail-Stop Scan contract for learning judgment and output
shape; do not restate it here.

| Condition | Record or surface | Resume condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unknown `data.route_id` | Raw state envelope and route ID | Runtime route contract fixed or clarified |
| Runbook version skew | Ledger version evidence and `ledger-and-helper.md` pointer | State envelope reports matched or continuation evidence present |
| Partial v2 install | Missing installed roots | Install or symlink repaired and state envelope reports all present |
| Stage 1 issue or branch unsafe | Closed/blocked issue, open blocker, abort, or default-branch evidence | Override flag supplied, blocker cleared, user resumes instead of aborting, or work moves to a feature branch; see `stage-1-pick-issue.md` |
| Stale or blocked ACs | Digest drift or AC block reason | User re-confirms ACs in Stage 1 |
| Stage 2 plan missing or empty | No plan output after the retry, or zero implementation units | Planning produces a plan with at least one unit, or the user reframes the request; see `stage-2-plan.md` |
| Stage 3 plan parse or DAG invalid | Verbatim parse error, or the offending dependency cycle | User revises the plan so parsing and DAG validation pass, then Stage 3 re-runs; see `stage-3-decompose.md` |
| Stage 3 open P0/P1 | Contract-review finding summary | Plan or batch contract revision closes the finding |
| Stage 3 contract-review cycle cap | Cap reached without convergence and last finding summary | User replans, narrows the contract, or accepts surfaced advisories; see `stage-3-decompose.md` |
| Stale batch contract or digests | Recomputed drift evidence | Stage 3 recompute and user confirmation |
| Host Builder tools unavailable | Host readiness failure before any Stage 4 implementation attempt, including Builder dispatch and bounded inline work; no attempt evidence, iteration increment, or Validator wave is recorded | Required host tools are available |
| Builder infrastructure failure | Malformed/missing Builder envelope and side effects | User decides whether to retry, repair, or reframe |
| No eligible batch | Pending batch dependencies | Dependencies converge or user reframes the DAG |
| Escape hatch or iteration cap | Hatch name and current batch/finding evidence | User accepts risk, authorizes replacement, or replans |
| Stage 5 reviewer coverage gap | Reviewer cap with no fallback covering correctness and testing | A fallback reviewer set covers correctness and testing; see `findings-and-validators.md` |
| Patch-batch confirmation required | Validated patch-batch proposal awaiting user decision | User confirms the patch batch (returns to Stage 4) or declines and replans; see `stage-4-batch-loop.md` |
| Final review needs replan | Finding that exceeds patch-batch scope | User replans or narrows the contract |
| Local check failure | Check name and failing summary | Synthetic P0 routes through Stage 5 and is closed |
| Unsafe final metadata checkpoint | Non-metadata path in final metadata checkpoint | Commit is repaired so only ledger/registry metadata is included |
| Unsupported smoke-direct request | Requested `smoke-direct` on a non-disposable repo | Target repo and checkout are disposable, or the standard ship path is used; see `stage-6-ship.md` |
| PR creation failure | Failing `gh pr create` / push evidence | Operator resolves the failure and the PR URL is recorded; see `stage-6-ship.md` |

Detailed hatch semantics + closure rules: `runbooks/issue-to-pr-v2/references/findings-and-validators.md`.

</fail_stops>

<review_loop>

Stage 4 uses an implementation/Validator convergence loop:

1. Orchestrator selects one eligible confirmed batch and records lifecycle state.
2. One implementation attempt runs against the confirmed batch. For `tdd` and `proof_first`, the attempt is always Builder dispatch: Builder receives one Work Packet, edits only confirmed `batch.files`, returns evidence. For `change_first`, Orchestrator MAY edit inline within the same `batch.files` authority boundary, but only while inline eligibility holds (see Stage 4 dispatch policy above); as soon as a dispatch trigger fires, the attempt MUST dispatch Builder. Inline attempts record their evidence in the Orchestrator-inline audit lane on the ledger, separate from Builder attempt evidence.
3. Orchestrator records the ledger-only `implementation_attempt_checkpoint` Notes evidence for the committed attempt before rendering Validator packets.
4. Validators review the committed attempt and own correctness findings. The full always-on wave runs regardless of path; completed-wave evidence is recorded in Notes.
5. Orchestrator records normalized findings in the ledger.
6. Open P0/P1 findings block batch convergence.
7. Repair attempts continue until no open P0/P1 remains, an accepted-risk decision is recorded, or a fail-stop fires. Repairs are Builder-only: an open P0/P1 after any committed attempt (Builder or inline) routes to Builder repair, never inline.

Each repair dispatch targets exactly one committed open P0/P1 finding signature and may land at most one Builder commit for that target. Run separate Builder repair dispatches for separate signatures; if the iteration cap would be exceeded, fail-stop for user choice instead of batching unrelated finding fixes into one repair packet.

Stage 5 repeats the same P0/P1 rule over the cumulative diff. A final review P0/P1 never becomes an Orchestrator-authored implementation fix: route through Proposer + patch-batch path back into Stage 4, or fail-stop when it needs replan.

</review_loop>
