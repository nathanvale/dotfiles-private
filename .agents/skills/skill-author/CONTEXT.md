# Skill Author Context

Scoped vocabulary for portable skill authoring, skill cleanup, capability ownership, and agent-native helper handoff.

This context owns reusable skill-creation language. Repo-specific domains keep their own nearest `CONTEXT.md`.

## Preview Index

- Read `Capability Ownership` before deciding which artifact owns a contract.
- Read `Agent-Native Helpers` before naming runtime-backed helper surfaces.

## Skill Design

**Skill routing**:
Model-side selection of a skill from name, description, request shape, and loaded context.
_Avoid_: invocation, execution, guaranteed activation, deterministic route

**Skill invocation**:
The runtime, user, or driver mechanism that makes a routed skill run.
_Avoid_: routing, discovery, description matching, model selection

**Manual fallback**:
An explicit callable route for a skill when automatic routing is not reliable enough.
_Avoid_: better description only, hidden fallback, guaranteed auto-trigger

**Skill driver**:
The human, plan, or agent that invokes a skill and supplies its working context.
_Avoid_: caller, agent-only mode, separate skill

**Routing evidence**:
Model-readable signal that helps skill routing without guaranteeing skill invocation.
_Avoid_: routing contract, deterministic activation, guaranteed match, prose contract

**Owner path**:
The authoritative file, command, script, doc, or runtime surface that owns a rule or contract.
_Avoid_: copied contract, prose duplicate, hidden owner

**Skill collision**:
Two or more skills competing for the same request shape.
_Avoid_: normal overlap, driver gap, routing contract failure

**Skill bridge**:
A temporary route used only when active route evidence proves a rename would break startup, an active skill, script, exported bundle, known external doc, or current user invocation.
_Avoid_: legacy wrapper, permanent duplicate, hidden alias, second owner

**Entry-screen route clarity**:
The first-screen skill shape that maps request shapes to owner paths, references, scripts, templates, and next safe actions.
_Avoid_: skill runbook, self-contained handbook, hidden reference tree, exhaustive catalog, workflow router

**Task family**:
A repeated request shape or workflow a skill is meant to handle.
_Avoid_: one-off prompt, implementation unit, user story, broad domain

**Overloaded actor**:
The user, agent, runtime, maintainer, or reviewer carrying avoidable work because the skill shape is wrong.
_Avoid_: vague stakeholder, blame target, ceremonial persona

**False-success scenario**:
A ship-but-fail case where the skill appears complete but fails its route, safety, owner, output, or verification job.
_Avoid_: generic risk, exhaustive test plan, worst imaginable failure

**Skill design decision runbook**:
Reference owner that helps choose the smallest skill shape, invocation mode, owner path, safety gate, and next safe action.
_Avoid_: second workflow owner, vague philosophy doc, required heading schema

**Heading Selection Matrix**:
Advisory matrix that helps choose `SKILL.md` body headings from use case and selection strength; not a body-heading contract.
_Avoid_: required heading schema, fixed heading template, body-heading contract

**Portable skill bundle**:
A skill bundle whose reusable workflow guidance avoids hidden repo-specific paths, local machine facts, personal assumptions, and harness-only contracts unless those limits are named.
_Avoid_: universal contract, copied repo policy, local-only skill, unstated harness dependency

**Runtime portability**:
The rule set for moving skill scripts and helper commands across machines by naming runtime, owner files, package metadata, lockfiles, verification path, and missing-dependency state.
_Avoid_: Bun-only policy, hidden local tool, script portability by assumption, universal claim

**Local development portability**:
A runtime-backed skill state where the skill works in this repo because a named local owner exists, but does not travel alone without that owner.
_Avoid_: universal portability, hidden local path, non-portable by surprise

**Shared portable runtime owner**:
A reusable runtime package that travels with a portable export payload so multiple skills can depend on one bundled implementation instead of copying helper code into each skill.
_Avoid_: per-skill copy, hidden local checkout, private package assumed universal

**Skill setup context**:
User-specific or environment-specific context a skill needs to operate.
_Avoid_: workflow prose, hidden contract, second skill body

**Context storage routing**:
Owner-first choice of storage bucket for durable context that survives the current turn.
_Avoid_: default store, storage catalog, case-by-case guess

**Storage routing map**:
The reference owner that defines context placement decision order, required facts, store categories, safety gates, and next safe actions.
_Avoid_: advisor skill, runtime store, content manager, legacy storage framework

**Context advisor**:
The advisor skill that recommends where durable context belongs by naming owner path, storage bucket, safety gate, rejected nearby buckets, and next safe action.
_Avoid_: context manager, legacy storage framework, capture workflow, storage runtime, content owner

**Context placement advice**:
The non-mutating output of a context advisor: recommendation, assumptions, safety stance, truth stance, rejected stores, and next action.
_Avoid_: storage write, migration, capture workflow, content management

**Project tracker**:
Scoped durable work-state owner for progress, open questions, queues, audits, blockers, and next actions.
In this repo, the owner path is `skills/coding-task-tracker/SKILL.md`.
_Avoid_: decision log, rulebook, domain glossary, source of accepted truth, default `TASKS.md`

**Accepted reusable rule**:
A user-approved skill-authoring rule that has landed in its owner path.
_Avoid_: chat-only agreement, tracker note, open question, proposed rule

**Validated reusable rule**:
An accepted reusable rule whose owner path changed, whose relevant checks passed, and whose change improves the task family against the skill quality bar.
_Avoid_: plausible improvement, untested proposal, chat-approved idea, snippet-derived rule

**Skill refinement**:
The evidence-driven process of improving a skill by routing refinement evidence into proposed owner-path changes, then accepting only validated reusable rules.
_Avoid_: self-improving AI, auto-update, autonomous mutation, prompt tweaking

**Skill quality bar**:
The task-family-specific standard used to decide whether a skill refinement improves the skill without adding avoidable carrying cost.
_Avoid_: generic quality, vibes, preference, universal rubric, prose polish

**Numbered router helper**:
Skill-authoring pattern for short `Next Safe Actions` reply-by-number menus at the current decision station. Uses one recommended default, likely branch jumps as menu options, and `Reply with a number, or say what outcome you want.` after the menu. Facade-backed Branch Station and Station Map behavior stays in `runtime/cli-command-facade/src/station-map.ts`, `skills/cli-execution-auditor/src/station-map.ts`, and `skills/cli-author/references/cli-command-facade.md`.
_Avoid_: exhaustive branch catalog, copied Station Map, chat-as-option, hidden recommendation, personal-productivity framing, copied runtime fields

**Run Card**:
A compact workflow scaffold for complex skills that names scope, defaults, first safe action, visible state, verification, fallback, and expected final shape.
_Avoid_: mandatory checklist, body-heading schema, exhaustive runbook, hidden process

**Refinement evidence**:
A source signal used to decide whether skill refinement is warranted: observed failure, review finding, adversarial probe, or research.
_Avoid_: hunch, theoretical risk, preference, context-free best practice

**Observed failure**:
A real skill miss seen during actual use.
_Avoid_: review finding, adversarial probe, hypothetical hole, theoretical risk

**Skill gotcha**:
A compact skill-local correction for a repeatable, non-obvious agent failure.
_Avoid_: generic tip, theoretical risk, broad best practice, copied research summary, full workflow prose

**Gotcha decision**:
The required create, review, or heal outcome that records whether refinement evidence produced no gotcha, an inline gotcha, reused existing guidance, or a safety gate.
_Avoid_: optional note, hidden consideration, mandatory empty Gotchas section

**Skill Doctor**:
A targeted quality-gate helper that produces a Skill Health Report for one selected skill target or review artifact.
_Avoid_: auto-healer, portfolio dashboard, periodic audit, broad repo sweep

**Skill self-audit loop**:
A stateful audit loop for one target `SKILL.md` where fresh passes add only new accepted contradictions to an audit loop file and stop when a pass adds none. It records evidence and repair candidates; it is not source repair or generic reviewer convergence.
_Avoid_: mvp-loop-maker, generic reviewer loop, auto repair, Skill Doctor

**Audit loop file**:
A committed repo-relative markdown state file at `docs/skill-audits/<skill-directory-name>/self-audit-loop.md` that carries the target skill, loaded owner paths, findings ledger, stop rule, repair handoff, and next safe action for a later `/goal` or `/loop` run. It is evidence and driver state, not canonical skill instruction or skill-local runbook material.
_Avoid_: canonical instruction, source patch, transcript archive, reviewer ledger, skill-local docs

**Skill contradiction**:
A supported conflict between two skill instruction sources where both cannot be followed at the same time. Common forms are authority conflict, scope conflict, lifecycle conflict, and safety conflict.
_Avoid_: style issue, vague wording, missing example, preference, general improvement

**Skill Health Report**:
A structured quality-gate result that separates target status, findings, repair hints, rerun evidence, and blocked or degraded handoff.
_Avoid_: scorecard, generic review notes, auto-fix plan, reusable-rule approval

## Capability Ownership

**Capability**:
A registry-managed skill or agent, together with the files owned by that skill or agent.

**Capability dependency**:
A manually declared skill or agent that a capability needs to work.
_Avoid_: auto dependency, inferred dependency, implicit dependency

**Hard dependency**:
A required owner path, skill, command, config, or data source that blocks the workflow when missing.
_Avoid_: best-effort fallback, hidden dependency, degraded mode

**Optional handoff**:
A skill-to-skill transfer that may be used when available, with a named fallback owner path when unavailable.
_Avoid_: hard dependency, silent skip, copied fallback

**Owner-reference fallback**:
A readable owner path used when an optional skill handoff is unavailable; contains rules, maps, safety gates, examples, and next safe action, not a duplicate workflow.
_Avoid_: hard dependency, hidden dependency, copied workflow

**Bundled reference**:
A reference file shipped inside the same skill folder so the skill carries its own deep notes when moved.
_Avoid_: repo-scattered reference, copied owner, hidden portable dependency

**Blocked state**:
A stop condition when a missing dependency, unsafe ambiguity, or unavailable owner would make the workflow unsafe or fake.
_Avoid_: degraded state, silent skip, improvised fallback

**Degraded state**:
A partial-work condition where the safe core workflow can continue while a non-essential feature is unavailable.
_Avoid_: blocked state, fake success, hidden missing dependency

**Dependency label**:
An explicit dependency type on a referenced skill, owner path, command, config, or data source.
_Avoid_: unlabeled dependency, hidden owner, assumed availability

**Capability risk flag**:
A composable review signal attached to a capability, such as secrets, writes, network use, or side effects.
_Avoid_: risk tier, risk level, lifecycle status

**Install target**:
A harness surface that may receive an installed capability.
_Avoid_: source, snapshot destination, install unit

**Alias wrapper**:
A thin redirect from an alternate capability name to the canonical capability name.
_Avoid_: duplicate copy, second canonical capability, forked alias

## Agent-Native Helpers

**Contract runtime**:
A runtime component that validates and enforces a declared contract.
_Avoid_: power tool, implementation guide, docs-owned schema, prose contract

**Runtime-backed capability**:
An agent-native CLI behavior already exposed or enforced by the contract runtime.
_Avoid_: future contract, aspirational contract, rubric-owned contract, prose contract

**Contract candidate**:
An agreed agent-native CLI behavior that may belong in the contract runtime later but is not yet runtime-backed.
_Avoid_: contract-owned, runtime-backed, required field, schema promise

**Minimum CLI design brief**:
The prose-level starting brief captured before choosing basic, agent-native, or facade-backed CLI depth.
_Avoid_: universal minimum CLI contract, minimum CLI contract, prose contract

The smallest behavior set a skill driver can safely rely on before deeper CLI contract design.
_Avoid_: full adoption checklist, maturity model, every rubric item, implementation plan

**Agent-native CLI design layer**:
The judgment layer that applies the CLI baseline to skill-driver workflows.
_Avoid_: overlay, rubric, contract runtime, agent-only skill

**Workflow Facade**:
A runtime owner for multi-step workflow orchestration, route policy, state transitions, and repair loops.
_Avoid_: runner facade, bigger runner, prose workflow, premature orchestrator
