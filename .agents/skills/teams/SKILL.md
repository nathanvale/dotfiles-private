description: "Read your own local Microsoft Teams cache, and send or quote-reply to Teams messages. Reading: what was said in a channel, who mentioned you, unread items, a ticket's discussion timeline, links or code someone shared, who a person is, or which of two same-named people said something. Sending: stage a message into a channel or DM via the teams-send / teams-reply commands (see Sending Messages). Triggers include \"what did X say in Teams\", \"Teams digest\", \"who mentioned me\", \"catch me up on the channel\", \"find that Teams message\", \"what was discussed about TICKET-123\", \"send a Teams message\", \"post to the dev channel\", \"reply to that message\". macOS only; reads are local-cache only with no network to Microsoft, sends drive the Teams app UI."

# Teams Local Reader

Queries the new Teams (v2) IndexedDB cache already on this Mac. **Reading** is
read-only: no Graph API, no app registration, no network to Microsoft.

**Sending is a separate surface.** The `teams_cli.py` commands below never write
anything to Teams. To actually send a message, use the `teams-send` /
`teams-reply` commands documented in [Sending Messages](#sending-messages) —
they live outside this skill directory, in `~/code/dotfiles/bin/`.

## First Safe Action

Run the CLI with no arguments — it prints a dashboard of what is cached and
which command to use next.

```bash
skills/teams/.venv/bin/python skills/teams/scripts/teams_cli.py
```

If `.venv` does not exist, run `skills/teams/scripts/bootstrap.sh` first
(one-time; needs network + git + Xcode command line tools).

## Searching: use QMD, not `search`

Every message read is saved as a markdown note in `~/.local/share/teams/` and
also indexed as the `teams` QMD collection. There are **three retrieval engines**;
pick by the shape of the question, not by habit.

### Retrieval router

| You want… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| An exact string, ticket key, or **recent** message (last days/weeks) | `search "<text>"` / `ticket <KEY>` / `digest [--hours N]` | Direct **live-cache** read. Fast enough (~sub-second to a few seconds) and catches fresh messages not yet in the corpus. |
| Keyword recall on recent chat, scoped by date or person | `search "<kw>" --since YYYY-MM-DD [--until …] [--from NAME\|MRI]` | Live-cache substring with frontmatter-equivalent filters (`m.time`, author, `creator_mri`). The default for scoped **recent** keyword lookups. |
| **Fast** keyword recall over **months** of history | `qmd search "<kw>" -c teams` | BM25 over the durable corpus. **Sub-second**, and retains messages the live cache has already aged out. Fastest historical path. |
| A **meaning-based** question over months — paraphrases, "who worried about X" | `qmd query "<question>" -c teams` | Vector + rerank. The **only** engine that finds paraphrases, but **10s–160s** per call. Deep one-shot recall only. |

**Fast path wins — route by speed, then reach for semantics only when you must.**
Measured on this corpus (formal A/B, 2026-07-29):

- **Direct CLI** (`search`/`digest`/`ticket`) — reads the **live cache**, ~sub-second
  to a few seconds. Catches fresh and not-yet-corpused messages. Can miss history that
  has aged out of the cache. **Default for anything recent.**
- **`qmd search` (BM25)** — reads the **durable corpus**, **~0.5s**. Retains aged-out
  history the live cache dropped, and is ~10× faster than the direct CLI for old
  keyword lookups. **Use it for fast historical keyword recall.** (This is a real niche:
  it beats the CLI on old messages and beats `qmd query` on speed.)
- **`qmd query` (vector+rerank)** — **10s–160s**, wildly variable. The only engine that
  recalls paraphrases with no shared keyword. **Never wire into a sync/batch path** —
  reserve for deep, one-shot "find where someone said X" questions where waiting is fine.

Rule of thumb: try the **fast** path first (direct CLI for recent, `qmd search` for old),
and escalate to `qmd query` only when a keyword search comes back empty and the question
is genuinely about meaning, not words.

**`qmd query` returns references, not attribution — always resolve before quoting.**
A hit gives you the message's file path (`qmd://teams/YYYY/MM/…​.md:NN`), the date
(in the path), a text snippet, and a score — but **not** the author, `from_mri`,
`conversation`, or exact timestamp. Those live in the note's frontmatter. Before you
attribute or ledger a semantic hit, run `qmd get "<path>"` on it and read the
frontmatter (`from`, `from_mri`, `conversation`, `sent_at`, `direction`). This
two-step is what keeps QMD recall attribution-safe when a display name is shared —
never quote a `qmd query` snippet's implied speaker without the `qmd get` resolve.

```bash
# semantic recall over the whole corpus
qmd query "who raised concerns about the deploy" -c teams
qmd query "bulk print decisions" -c teams -c repo-pos-yellow   # chat + project docs

# scoped keyword recall — fast, deterministic
skills/teams/.venv/bin/python skills/teams/scripts/teams_cli.py \
  search "deploy" --since 2026-07-20 --from "Sonny" --json
```

Scope QMD with `-c teams` for "what did someone say". Repeat the flag to widen;
comma-separated names do **not** work. Leave it off only for genuine
cross-source questions — the collection is ~9,000 short chat messages and will
otherwise outweigh curated docs on general queries.

Note frontmatter carries `from_mri`, `conversation`, `sent_at` and `direction`,
so retrieved notes can be filtered or attributed without re-reading the store.

`sync` refreshes the **BM25 index only** after writing (fast) — so `qmd search -c
teams` is live immediately, but **vector embeddings are deferred**. Run vectors as a
separate, slow step at the end of a batch: `teams embed` (or `sync --embed` to do both
at once, or `cd ~/.local/share/teams && qmd embed` by hand). This is deliberate: a
freshly-synced corpus is keyword-searchable at once, and the expensive embed never
blocks the sync. Until `embed` runs, `qmd query` (vector) may miss the newest messages
while `qmd search` (BM25) already has them.

(The collection is registered as `teams` → `~/.local/share/teams`; if `qmd query
-c teams` ever returns nothing, confirm with `qmd collection show teams` that its
path is the corpus root and not a phantom subdirectory.)

## Choosing a Command

Discover the command surface instead of guessing from this file:

```bash
skills/teams/.venv/bin/python skills/teams/scripts/teams_cli.py commands --json
```

Common routes:

| Ask | Command |
|-----|---------|
| what happened recently | `digest [--hours N]` |
| tell me when my channels move | `poll [--once]` |
| find an exact string (recent) | `search "<text>"` |
| keyword recall on recent chat, scoped | `search "<kw>" --since YYYY-MM-DD [--from NAME\|MRI]` |
| fast keyword recall over months | `qmd search "<kw>" -c teams` (durable corpus, ~0.5s) |
| find a message by meaning over months | `qmd query "..." -c teams` (slow, 10-160s; see router above) |
| backfill + reindex the corpus | `sync` |
| who pinged me | `mentions [--unread]` |
| what is waiting | `unread` |
| everything about a ticket | `ticket <KEY>` |
| one channel over a date range | `history "<channel>" --since YYYY-MM-DD` |
| rebuild a conversation | `thread "<keyword>"` |
| links / code someone shared | `links`, `code` |
| who is this person | `whois "<name>"`, `people` |
| two people, same name | `disambiguate "<name>"` |
| what got reacted to | `reactions` |
| what was asked of me | `requests --to-me` (candidates, judge them) |
| **send a message** | `teams-send "<channel>" <file>` (see [Sending Messages](#sending-messages)) |
| **quote-reply to a message** | `teams-reply "<original text>" <file>` (staging only, finish by hand) |

Add `--json` to any command for a structured envelope. Diagnostics go to
stderr, so `--json` stdout stays parseable.

## Sending Messages

**Not part of `teams_cli.py`.** Sending lives in two standalone commands in
`~/code/dotfiles/bin/` (symlinked into `~/bin`, so they are on `PATH`). They
drive the Teams app UI with Peekaboo. They depend on *this* skill: the shared
lib resolves conversation names through `teams_cli.py`, so the venv must be
bootstrapped for sending to work.

> **Do not conclude sending is unavailable from this skill's read-only framing.**
> `teams_cli.py commands --json` lists no send verb by design — the send path is
> a separate binary. Check `which teams-send` before saying it cannot be done.

### `teams-send` — post a message to a channel or DM

```bash
teams-send <conversation> <file|-> [--send]
```

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<conversation>` | Channel or person name as it appears in Teams (`"POS Yellow Devs"`, `"Sonny Hartley"`). Resolved against the local cache; ambiguous or unknown names abort and print the candidates. |
| `<file\|->` | File containing the message body, or `-` to read stdin. Empty/whitespace-only aborts. |
| `--send` | Also press Enter. **Off by default, on purpose.** |

```bash
teams-send "POS Yellow Devs" ./message.txt        # stage only — you press Enter
teams-send "Sonny Hartley" ./msg.txt --send       # stage and send
echo "quick note" | teams-send "June Xu" -        # from stdin
```

**Default is staging: the text lands in the compose box and stops.** Prefer this.
Let the human read it in Teams and hit Enter. Reserve `--send` for messages the
user has explicitly approved for auto-send.

**Safety gates (why it is hard to misfire):**
1. Resolves the target to a single conversation id from the local cache, or aborts with candidates.
2. Requires Teams to be frontmost before any keystroke — otherwise typing goes to the calling terminal.
3. Navigates by deep link, then **verifies the window title names the requested conversation** before pasting.
4. With `--send`, **re-verifies focus and conversation immediately before pressing Enter** (focus can move between staging and sending).
5. On paste failure, puts the text on the clipboard and exits without sending.
6. Screenshots after staging (and after sending), printing the paths.

**Exit codes:** `0` staged/sent · `1` usage or resolution error · `2` safety gate failed.

### `teams-reply` — quote-reply to an existing message

```bash
teams-reply <search-text> <file|->
```

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<search-text>` | Distinctive text from the message being replied to. **Use as much of the original as possible** — the exact match then sorts to the top of the results, which is the row the script clicks. |
| `<file\|->` | File containing your reply, or `-` for stdin. |

```bash
teams-reply "Joshua Green can this be reviewed today" ./reply.txt
echo "Thanks" | teams-reply "can this be reviewed today" -
```

⚠️ **Less robust than `teams-send`, and it does not complete the reply.** Teams
exposes no accessibility elements for search results or the hover toolbar, so it
clicks **screen coordinates** derived from the current window geometry. A
different window size, zoom level, or Teams update moves them.

It stages **navigation only**: it searches, clicks the top result to jump to the
message, screenshots, and stops — deliberately *not* clicking "Reply with quote",
because a wrong click quote-replies to the wrong message in front of the channel.
Your reply text is left on the clipboard. Finish by hand: check the screenshot,
hover the message, click the 99 icon, paste.

**Prefer `teams-send` whenever a plain message will do.**

### Choosing between them

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| New message to a channel or person | `teams-send` |
| Reply that only needs to mention who/what it is about | `teams-send`, naming the person in the text |
| Reply that genuinely needs the quoted original attached | `teams-reply`, then finish by hand |

## Pull vs notify

Two different jobs, two different commands. Keeping them separate is what lets
each one be simple.

- **`digest --hours N` is the pull path, and covers everything.** The time
  window IS the filter: a conversation with activity in the window is relevant
  by definition, one without contributes nothing. It never narrows by channel.
  (Measured 2026-07-30: a 24h window had 12 active conversations out of 156
  cached, only 4 of which were on the watch list — the old allowlist behaviour
  was silently dropping the other 8, including the channel where PRs are
  reviewed.) Pass `--only-watched` to get the old narrowing back.
- **`poll` is the notify path, and that is what `watch` is for.** It appends
  new messages in watched channels, plus any `@mention` wherever it lands, to a
  tailable log (default `$XDG_STATE_HOME/teams/watch.log`, mode `0600`). Own
  messages are never reported back. `--once` for cron; bare `poll` loops with
  `--interval` seconds between passes. Its cursor is
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/teams/poll-cursor.json` — separate from the corpus cursor,
  so polling never consumes a window `digest` or `sync` would otherwise see.

`watch` therefore no longer affects `digest` at all. Its only job is deciding
what is worth interrupting you for.

## Gotchas That Change Results

- **Freshness.** The newest messages are not in the cache until Teams flushes
  its LevelDB memtable. Keep Teams running for a current cache. A missing
  recent message is usually lag, not absence.
- **Attribution.** Two people can share a display name. Attribute by
  `creator_mri`, not by `author`, and run `disambiguate` when it matters.
- **Synthetic `48:*` feeds are not chats.** Teams keeps client-side feeds
  alongside real conversations, addressed as `48:notifications` (the activity /
  mentions panel) and `48:calllogs`. Every record in them is stored with *your*
  MRI as `creator` and `isSentByCurrentUser=True`, because you own the feed —
  not because you wrote the message. The reader now forces `from_me=False` and
  `creator_mri=None` on these, so they cannot be misattributed to you; their
  `author` reads `(unknown)`. They are **not** filtered out, because 10 of the
  12 notification entries in this store exist only there with no real twin, so
  dropping them would lose real content. Treat a `48:*` message as "something
  addressed to you, sender unrecoverable from this record" — find the real
  sender by searching the message text in its source conversation.
- **Unread is not per-message.** This cache keeps no per-message read horizon.
  `unread` reports unread *activity-feed items* and *conversations*; channel
  threads carry no read flag at all.
- **`requests`, `decisions` and `standup` retrieve candidates, they do not
  classify.** Each row carries its evidence — `matched` (which phrase fired),
  `addressed_to_me`, `is_question`, `automated` — because deciding whether a
  message *is* a request needs tense, speaker and addressee, which keywords
  cannot see. Read the evidence and judge; never quote their output as a
  finding. `requests` ranks addressed-to-you questions first and drops bot
  PR/deploy traffic (`--include-automated` keeps it, `--to-me` narrows harder).

## The Corpus

Reading is saving. Every command that returns messages writes them as notes:

- corpus: `~/.local/share/teams/YYYY/MM/*.md` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME`), dirs `0700`,
  files `0600` — this is corporate chat, so it never goes in a repo or in
  `~/Documents` (which may be iCloud-synced)
- cursor: `~/.local/state/teams/cursor.json` (`$XDG_STATE_HOME`)

`--no-save` opts a command out; `--save-dir` relocates. The corpus is
rebuildable from the Teams cache at any time with `sync --full`.

## Configuration

Optional. Copy `teams-reader.example.yaml` to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/teams/teams-reader.yaml` (default `~/.config/teams/`) to set a
watch list, a ticket pattern for your tracker, and lookback defaults. An
in-skill `teams-reader.yaml` (gitignored) still works as a legacy fallback.
Without any config, everything still works over all cached conversations.

Identity is auto-detected and cross-checked against the store; set `self.mri`
only if `whoami` reports low confidence.

## Owner Anchors

- Command contract, flags, JSON envelope: `scripts/teams_cli.py commands --json`.
  **Reading only** — the send commands are not in this surface.
- Prerequisites, store layout, troubleshooting: `references/operations.md`.
- Config keys: `teams-reader.example.yaml`.
- **Sending**: `~/code/dotfiles/bin/teams-send` and `~/code/dotfiles/bin/teams-reply`
  (each `--help` is the contract); shared helpers in
  `~/code/dotfiles/bin/lib/teams-automation.sh`. That lib reads `TEAMS_SKILL`
  (default `~/.claude/skills/teams`) to resolve conversation names through this
  skill's venv, so sending breaks if the venv is missing.
