// U7 run wrapper mechanics: the `--`-boundary parser, endpoint injection into the
// wrapped command, and the spawn-and-wait passthrough (R1/R14/R17/R18; KTD4/KTD5).
//
// This module owns the NET-NEW, no-repo-precedent pieces of `run`:
//   - splitRunArgv: split argv at the FIRST `--`. The head is browser-connect's
//     own argv (adapter id + flags); the tail is the wrapped command VERBATIM and
//     is never scanned for --help/--version/unknown flags (the dispatcher must
//     split before those global checks, cli.ts).
//   - applyInjection: apply the Adapter Definition's `inject(endpoint)` result
//     (`{ argv, env? }`) into the wrapped command's invocation — argv prepended
//     after the wrapped executable, env merged over the base env. Pure.
//   - runWrappedCommand: spawn-and-wait with full stdio inheritance including
//     stdin, SIGINT/SIGTERM forwarded to the child, signal-death mapped to
//     128+signal, and the child's exit code passed through unchanged (R17).
//     Spawn-and-wait (not exec(2) process replacement) is the deliberate choice
//     for portability + signal handling: Bun's `process.execve()` is POSIX-only,
//     experimental, and unavailable on Windows and worker threads, whereas
//     spawn-and-wait gives the SIGINT/SIGTERM forwarding + no-orphan guarantees
//     we need cross-platform.
//
// The wrapped command runs with the caller's authority, uninspected (R18): its
// argv is NEVER echoed into an envelope or diagnostic (R14/KTD10). Only run-exec's
// own diagnostic text (the spawn-failure line) is authored here, and the caller
// routes it through browser-connect's redactor.
