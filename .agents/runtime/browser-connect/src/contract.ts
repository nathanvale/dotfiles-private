// Verified Handoff Envelope payload contract (KTD6/R8).
//
// Value-free by design: this module declares only types so consumers can
// `import type` the envelope payload shape without pulling any browser-connect
// runtime into their bundle. The leaf unions are declared as literal unions
// here; `model.ts` keeps the runtime const arrays and enforces compile-time
// parity in both directions, so the literals cannot drift.
//
// Consumers pin the contract id and schema version LOCALLY (Decision 1): a
// schema rev must fail closed on an unrevised consumer, so those constants are
// deliberately not exported from here.
