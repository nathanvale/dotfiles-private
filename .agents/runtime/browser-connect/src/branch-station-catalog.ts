/**
 * Package-owned Branch Station Catalog for the browser-connect CLI (R2/R7/R11/
 * R15/R17). All nineteen slice-one stations from the Planning Contract plus
 * the four U5 repair-adapter stations (preview, installed, upgraded, and the
 * fourteenth error station `repair-adapter.operator_stop` — R1), keyed
 * `<command>.<branch>` so the facade station-id pattern and command-prefix
 * cross-check both hold.
 *
 * One station carries one canonical error code (its branch id) and one primary
 * action id resolved from the model's affordance catalog. Both `check.*` and
 * `connect.*` foreign-listener stations map to the single `foreign-listener`
 * failure class; the error code names the command-local branch, and the action
 * id names the shared next-safe action. Fine-grained cause stays in the
 * `reason`/`detail` the U4+ runtime emits, never in the error code.
 *
 * Command homes: the two cross-command families from the plan table
 * (`usage-invalid` "any", `runtime-error-unexpected" "any") are homed on
 * `check` as `check.usage_invalid` and `check.runtime_error` — the first
 * non-dashboard command, mirroring warm-chrome's homing of its `invalid_usage`
 * and `runtime_failure` stations on `check`. `connect.adapter_unknown` is the
 * distinct connect-scoped usage rejection (adapter not in registry) and stays
 * separate from the generic usage station.
