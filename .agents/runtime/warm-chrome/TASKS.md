# Warm Chrome Tasks

Hot-path project-manager dashboard.

Agent route: `AGENTS.md`. Decision lineage:
`docs/decisions/2026-07-03-warm-chrome-runtime-package-definition.md`.
Archive: `TASKS.archive.md`.

## Governance

- Keep this file short enough to read before acting.
- Keep active tasks here.
- Move completed detail to `TASKS.archive.md` in the same pass that closes it.
- Add at most 10 open tasks per priority group.
- Keep at most 5 Latest Signals; archive or drop older ones.
- Write tasks as verifiable slices.
- Include the next command, source owner, or decision when known.
- Leave historical plan docs unchanged unless archive wording misleads current
  agents.

Task shape:

```markdown
- [ ] P0/P1/P2 Title Lane: Switchover. Done when: observable command,
      test, or doc result. Next: `command`.
```

Lanes: Switchover, Proof Chain, Lifecycle, CLI Contract, Seam, Docs Language,
Verification.

## Current Priority

Implementation U1-U8 closed on 2026-07-03. Eighteen stations, redaction proofs,
entrypoint gate membership, and docs-drift are live. The browser-use switchover
closed on 2026-07-04 and the interim delegator retired on 2026-07-16 (migration
cleanup U5/KTD6): browser entry reaches this package only through
`runtime/browser-connect` in-process, and browser-use consumes the Verified
Handoff Envelope. This package is now the single owner of the production Warm
Chrome proof path. Retired-path detail: `TASKS.archive.md` + Latest Signals.

Next safe action:

```bash
skills/test-runner/src/test-runner.sh run -- runtime/warm-chrome/tests/
```

## Now

No active P1 work. Identity-and-launch closeout moved to `TASKS.archive.md`.

## Next

- [ ] P2 Platform guard decision Lane: Proof Chain. Done when: a decision
      records whether the package needs the old preflight's
      `unsupported_platform` refusal (exit 1 on non-darwin) or the seam's
      macOS-only tools fail loud enough. The parity row that measured this gap
      (`check_non_darwin_platform`) is gone with the harness; re-establish the
      gap with a station test if the decision keeps the guard. Next: record in
      the package decision log.
- [ ] P2 Symlink-write TOCTOU closure Lane: Seam. Done when: the repair
      DevToolsActivePort write uses an O_NOFOLLOW/tmp-rename seam primitive
      and profile realpath verification happens before mkdir/chmod. Next:
      resolve-then-verify before extending the U4 seam.
- [ ] P2 Station-contract residuals decision Lane: CLI Contract. Done when: a
      recorded decision resolves the three review residuals that each change a
      Station-Map contract: (1) launch `unsafe_profile` routes `change_input`
      while the catalog's only `unsafe_profile` station says `repair_profile` -
      needs a launch-owned station or a documented re-emit exception; (2)
      `check.endpoint_unreachable` catalog action is `launch_warm_chrome`, but
      the runtime override routes most reasons to `inspect_listener` -
      single-action-per-station cannot express per-reason routing; (3) the
      pre-bind refusal reuses `launch.spawned_unverified` whose trigger and
      mutation pins claim a spawn happened. Next: `record-decision` against
      the catalog drift gate.
- [ ] P3 Race-convergence follow-up Lane: Lifecycle. Done when: a calibration
      decision records whether the 15s launch readiness budget is the right
      window for real-Chrome startup contention. Next: fold into the manual
      real-Chrome calibration run.
- [ ] P3 CLI-surface minors Lane: CLI Contract. Done when: `help <typo>`
      exits 2 not 0, per-command rendered help lists the global diagnostic
      flags (`WARM_CHROME_GLOBAL_DIAGNOSTIC_FLAGS` now rides the discovery
      tree only), and the `check.non_loopback` trigger wording covers the
      `localhost_alias` reason. Next: fix in `src/cli.ts` +
      `src/branch-station-catalog.ts` with `tests/cli-surface.test.ts` pins.
- [ ] P3 Leading-zero port normalization Lane: Proof Chain. Done when:
      `--port 09222` cannot yield a spurious `non_loopback_websocket` verdict
      (URL normalizes `ws.port` to `9222` while `input.port` stays `09222`).
      Next: normalize the port in `assertPort` or compare numerically.
- [ ] P3 Sixth-pass robustness nits Lane: Proof Chain. Low-severity,
      pathological-trigger findings docketed together: (1)
      `scanSuggestedExplicitPort` (`src/proof.ts` ~1067) runs up to 77
      sequential `findListener`/`lsof` probes with no aggregate budget, so if
      `lsof` consistently hits its 3s `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` the
      `port_occupied_foreign` envelope is delayed ~4 min; (2)
      `fetchLoopbackJson` (`src/runtime.ts` ~681) accumulates the response
      body with no size cap, so an untrusted loopback listener can drive a
      large allocation within the 5s deadline before any identity check; (3)
      `readSingletonLock` (`src/runtime.ts` ~340) throws uncatalogued
      `listener_uninspectable` on any non-ENOENT `readlink` fault, so a
      SingletonLock materialized as a regular file (EINVAL) blocks launch with
      no repair path. Next: aggregate scan budget, body cap, and an EINVAL
      arm; each is in-runtime and needs a pin.
- [ ] P3 Default-profile redaction consistency Lane: CLI Contract. Partly
      closed by the CodeRabbit round (env-less `redactListenerDetail` now
      guards unconditionally via the HOME-absent fallback, pinned in
      `tests/redaction.test.ts`). Remaining, folds into the P2
      profile-predicate duplication item: `redactListenerProfileDir`
      (`src/repair.ts` ~207) and the `profile_not_owned` `profile_dir` echo
      (~285) only redact ABSOLUTE default-profile spellings; a relative
      spelling reaches the envelope verbatim. Low severity (relative paths do
      not carry the OS account name; the resolved-realpath echo is the
      operator's own HOME on their own terminal). Next: route every
      default-profile-path echo through one redactor when the predicate gets a
      single owner.

## Later

- [ ] P3 Browser Adapter Proof Lane: Lifecycle. Done when: the deferred
      adapter-side proof exists and forbids adapters from defaulting to the
      CDP convention after a suggested-port success (charter deferred scope;
      the sharpest recorded system risk). Next: new plan; out of package
      scope today.
- [ ] P3 WebDriver BiDi watch item Lane: Proof Chain. Done when: a dated note
      records whether CDP probe churn (Chrome 144+ hardening cadence)
      warrants a BiDi migration decision. Next: re-check the research capture
      against the then-current Chrome major.

## Latest Signals

- 2026-08-14: Both labelled actions installed and passed live crossover proof.
  Everyday Chrome launched regular Chrome with no Agent flags and left the
  Agent endpoint target count unchanged. Agent Chrome reused the exact verified
  process and created one page. The wrappers still host Google's Chrome bundle;
  full Finder, Dock, and external-link isolation remains a V2 experiment.
- 2026-08-14: The stale `avatar_helper_profile_running` alert came from old
  production-id `.app` rollback siblings discoverable by Launch Services.
  Installer backups now live under private Agent Chrome application support
  with a non-`.app` suffix; the exact installed helper verifies healthy reuse.
- 2026-08-14: Exact-pid visual proof corrected the earlier false failure.
  Agent Chrome and everyday Chrome both expose `com.google.Chrome`; Computer
  Use selected everyday Chrome and reported **Person 1**. Activating the Warm
  Chrome proof-returned pid showed **Agent Chrome** and the generated image in
  the exact toolbar and profile menu. Nathan accepted the visible identity.
  Chrome clears the local GAIA backing filename after loading it while retaining
  the rendered session image; cold launch therefore reapplies it. File checks
  remain preparation evidence, not visual acceptance.
- 2026-08-14: Launch Services cold-start proof passed after an Agent Chrome-only
  App Management reset: exact profile, pid, and port `9242` verified; no TCC row
  or warning returned. A simultaneous legacy `~/.agent-warm-profile` listener
  also proved that port-only health is insufficient; the exact-profile check
  correctly refused `profile_mismatch`.
- 2026-07-16: browser-use delegator retired (migration cleanup U5/KTD6).
  The retired preflight-warm-chrome source, test, and bin were deleted; the only
  consumer path is now `runtime/browser-connect` in-process. The
  delegator's `BROWSER_USE_*` -> `WARM_CHROME_*` env bridge retired with it.
