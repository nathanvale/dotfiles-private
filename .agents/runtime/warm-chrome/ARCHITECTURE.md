# Warm Chrome Architecture

Package architecture for `@side-quest/warm-chrome`.

## Shape

`warm-chrome` is a facade-backed CLI that owns Warm Chrome browser-entry
proof: verify real headed Google Chrome on a dedicated persistent profile
behind a numeric-loopback CDP endpoint, or fail with a canonical station code,
a machine-readable reason detail, and a repair path — before any browser
adapter acts.

Its interface is:

- `warm-chrome` bin (`src/cli.ts`, source-linked via the package `bin`).
- `agent-chrome-install`, `agent-chrome-profile-avatar`, and
  `agent-chrome-profile-migrate` preview-first product lifecycle bins under
  `app/`.
- `src/command-contract.ts` command facade contract built on
  `@side-quest/cli-command-facade`.
- No-arg `warm-chrome` and `warm-chrome help [command]` render help without
  browser work.
- JSON result envelopes carrying `contract_id` `warm-chrome.browser-entry`
  and `schema_version` for agents; plain output for humans (`status`).
- Package-owned exit code `20` (browser-entry failure, never adapter
  fallback) beside the facade baseline `0`/`1`/`2`.
- No generated local state from `check`/`status`; `launch` may start local
  Chrome or create a target, and `repair` may mutate dedicated-profile proof
  state.
- The installed `Agent Chrome.app` is a copied and signed native launcher with
  embedded compiled Warm Chrome and profile-avatar helpers plus the generated
  Agent Chrome artwork. Its Warm Chrome runtime delegates cold process creation
  to an embedded Launch Services helper so Agent Chrome is not the responsible
  process for Google Chrome app-bundle activity.

The Module Map below is the single per-module owner list. `AGENTS.md` and
`README.md` point here instead of repeating it; `tests/docs-drift.test.ts`
keeps the map complete in both directions.

## Maintainer Surfaces

- `AGENTS.md`: maintainer route, source owners, change recipes, doc drift
  gate, debug path, safety invariants, and verification.
- `README.md`: human front door, command posture, authority, safety rules,
  and develop commands.
- `CONTEXT.md`: package language for stations, proof, endpoint authority,
  mutation, and maintenance workflows.
- `TASKS.md`: active project-manager dashboard.
- `TASKS.archive.md`: closed task detail and long review rationale.
- `tests/docs-drift.test.ts`: Module Map drift gate plus maintainer doc-set
  presence check.

## Command Surface

| Command | Posture | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check` | Read-only proof chain; JSON default; every failure is a canonical station | `src/proof.ts`, `src/cli.ts` |
| `status` | Presentation alias of `check`; plain default; no stations of its own | `src/command-contract.ts`, `src/cli.ts` |
| `launch` | Spawns real Chrome only when nothing listens; optional proof-first open; fail-closed classification; race policy | `src/launch.ts`, `src/cli.ts` |
| `repair` | Profile-state repair (dir, chmod 0o700, DevToolsActivePort hygiene), then re-prove; refusal, never termination | `src/repair.ts`, `src/cli.ts` |

Exit codes are contract-owned: `0` verified, `1` runtime failure, `2` invalid
usage, `20` browser entry required (`no_adapter_fallback` rides every exit-20
envelope).

Input fallbacks: `WARM_CHROME_CDP_PORT`, `WARM_CHROME_PROFILE_DIR`,
`WARM_CHROME_RUN_ID`, and launch-only `CHROME_BIN`. Global diagnostic flags:
`--run-id`, `--quiet`, `--verbose`, `--debug`.

## Module Map

- `package.json`: bin, exports, `test` and `typecheck` scripts, workspace
  facade contract.
- `src/model.ts`: contract id, schema version, command ids, exit code `20`,
  dedicated profile directory/name constants, runtime-action ids, the
  `no_adapter_fallback` constraint id, and the closed check and repair
  reason-detail unions plus repair mutation ids.
- `src/command-contract.ts`: facade contract entries per command, flags,
  exit-code meanings, result contract, action affordances, preview notes,
  Command Discovery Tree projection.
- `src/branch-station-catalog.ts`: the eighteen-station Branch Station Catalog
  (station = canonical code = primary action = mutation pin), the re-emit map
  for proof failures reached via `launch`/`repair`, and the drift gate.
- `src/branch-station-evidence.ts`: evidence manifest — station tests attach
  envelope evidence; missing or contradicting evidence is a drift finding.
- `src/runtime.ts`: the injectable runtime seam (env, listener probe, profile
  stat, spawn handle with explicit Chrome profile-directory selection,
  SingletonLock probe), `WarmChromeRuntimeError`, process command parsing, and
  the websocket/listener redaction helpers.
- `src/proof.ts`: the single check proof chain — loopback assertion, bounded
  attach probe, listener identity, default-profile foreignness (R6c),
  payload validation, CDP round-trips (headless and isolated-context rejects),
  profile posture, final listener consistency, and the suggested-explicit-port
  scan. `DevToolsActivePort` is non-authoritative hint material.
- `src/launch.ts`: launch lifecycle — pre-spawn short-circuit, optional
  proof-first target creation, target verification, and post-open proof,
  competing 9222-instance guard,
  fail-closed classification, SingletonLock pre-bind refusal, bounded readiness
  poll, and the own-child race policy.
- `src/repair.ts`: repair lifecycle — foreign-listener refusal (R11), profile
  dir creation, ownership-gated chmod, diagnosed DevToolsActivePort hygiene
  with the never-follow-symlink guard, profile-policy inspection and mutation,
  and emission of model-owned repair reasons and mutation ids.
- `src/cli.ts`: argv parsing, dispatch, diagnostics configuration and the
  R13 redaction chokepoints, station envelope emission, error normalization,
  and runtime-action guidance.
- `src/index.ts`: re-exports the package seam.
- `app/agent-chrome.swift`: native launcher; consumes helper proof, activates
  only the returned Browser pid, and verifies foreground pid equality.
- `app/everyday-chrome.swift`: human-only launcher; asks Launch Services for the
  regular Google Chrome lane with no profile, CDP, or adapter arguments.
- `app/native-runtime.ts`: installed-app Warm Chrome entrypoint; retains the
  proof lifecycle while replacing direct Chrome spawn with an embedded Launch
  Services call and fail-closed exact-pid termination.
- `app/chrome-launch-services.swift`: validates the fixed Google Chrome app and
  dedicated profile inputs, launches a new Chrome instance through
  `NSWorkspace.OpenConfiguration`, and returns its pid.
- `app/install.ts`: preview-first paired build, inside-out ad-hoc signing,
  strict verification, foreign-destination refusal, paired install/rollback,
  and private non-application retained backups.
- `app/profile-avatar.ts`: preview-first, stopped-profile product branding;
  installs the generated artwork through Chrome's persistent high-resolution
  local-avatar file and metadata owners, preserves browser-account artwork on
  signed-in profiles, and never accepts an Everyday Chrome path.
- `app/migrate-profile.ts`: fixed-source, fixed-destination, stopped-Browser
  preserving migration with metadata verification and unchanged legacy
  rollback state.
- `app/agent-chrome-info.plist`, `app/everyday-chrome-info.plist`, and
  `app/assets/`:
  installed bundle metadata and visual identity sources.
- `tests/`: one suite per lifecycle (`check-stations`, `launch-stations`,
  `repair-stations`), `catalog.test.ts` drift gate, `cli-surface.test.ts`
  contract alignment, `redaction.test.ts` R13 proofs,
  `entrypoint.integration.test.ts` process-boundary stations, and
  `docs-drift.test.ts` module-map drift, `agent-chrome-app.test.ts` paired
  labelled-action install and rollback proof, `native-runtime.test.ts`
  pid-custody proof,
  `profile-avatar.test.ts` product-avatar isolation proof, and
  `profile-migration.test.ts` preservation proof.

## Proof Flow

  Endpoint["numeric loopback assertion"] --> Attach["bounded /json/version attach probe"]
  Attach -- "timeout / refused" --> Unreachable["endpoint_unreachable / port_occupied_foreign"]
  Attach --> Listener["listener identity by binary path<br/>(banner is untrusted input)"]
  Listener -- foreign --> Foreign["port_occupied_foreign + suggested_explicit_port"]

  Final --> Verified["ok envelope: the only endpoint authority (R8)"]
```

Station stance:

- One station = one canonical error code = one primary action; fine-grained
  cause lives in the closed `data.reason` union, never in the code.
- Proof-failure stations live under `check`; `launch` and `repair` re-emit
  them by reference. The one exception is `launch.spawned_unverified`: a
  post-spawn proof failure has mutated the workspace where a read-only check
  failure has not, which the re-emit rule cannot express.
- The ok envelope is the only endpoint authority; guidance carries the actual
  verified endpoint, never the `9222` convention.
- The switchover is closed: the parity harness that measured old-vs-new
  station/exit/envelope parity is retired, and the browser-use thin delegator
  that bridged the cutover is deleted (migration cleanup U5/KTD6). The
  in-process consumer is `runtime/browser-connect`.
