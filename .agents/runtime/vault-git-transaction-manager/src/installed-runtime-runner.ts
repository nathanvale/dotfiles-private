/**
 * Resolve the single installed-runtime runner contract shared by Completion
 * Vault Check and the checker-admission execution lane.
 *
 * The admitted runtime is a `bun build --compile` executable, so a bare
 * `run check` argv would reach the embedded Vault Git program as ordinary
 * arguments and misreport invalid usage as a check verdict. `BUN_BE_BUN=1`
 * makes those exact bytes behave as the plain Bun CLI, and the sibling `bun`
 * alias Setup installs beside the runtime lets a package check script invoke
 * `bun` through the isolated PATH without ambient authority. The alias is
 * derived from the canonical runtime path and realpath-verified to the same
 * file rather than trusting another binary; an unresolvable, non-executable,
 * missing-alias, or redirected-alias runner is unusable and must classify as
 * a setup defect, never as vault content.
 *
 * Consumers must execute package scripts as `exec <script line>`, never
 * `run <script name>`: bun's run-script lane prepends the machine-shared
 * /tmp bun-node shim ahead of this isolated PATH, which hands nested `bun`
 * to ambient bytes even though the alias beside the runtime is verified.
 *
 * @param runtimeBinaryPath - Absolute activation-bound runtime executable
 * @returns The spawn contract, or a closed refusal reason
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const admission = admitVaultGitCheckCommand(manifest)
 * const runner = await resolveVaultGitInstalledRuntimeRunner(runtimePath)
 * if (runner.status === "resolved" && admission.status === "admitted") {
 *   await processPort.run({ command: runner.command, args: ["exec", admission.commandLine], env: runner.environment, ... })
 * }
 * ```
