# Testing patterns for vault-git-transaction-manager

How the test suite proves durable-state, concurrency, and recovery claims here. Read before creating or changing a test in this package. Covers the conventions the layout and `package.json` do not confess; for the durable domain language read `CONTEXT.md`, and complete a `test-design` brief before writing.

## Lane map

Tests split by the claim they prove, not by the file they cover.

- **Unit / composition** (`tests/*.test.ts`) — one collaborator graph, fakes at the edges. Most of the suite.
- **Integration** (`tests/*.integration.test.ts`) — real Git against a temp bare remote, real receipt store on a temp dir. Used where the claim is about real git effects or cross-process recovery.
- **Live acceptance** (`tests/live-acceptance/*.integration.test.ts`) — 21 public-process correctness rows split across five workflow owners. `manifest.test.ts` rejects missing files, duplicate row ownership, and row-count drift before `run.ts` executes each owner once.
- **Hosted PR acceptance** (`tests/pr-acceptance/`) — five public-process canaries: three unique refusal/recovery boundaries, bounded two-caller repair re-entry, and one atomic-success canary. Its manifest rejects missing, duplicate, filtered, or renamed rows before the runner emits one aggregate receipt.
- **Foreground performance** (`tests/performance.integration.test.ts`) — two isolated latency proofs. Completion measures foreground settlement while separately requiring background continuation; Doctor measures 20 cold public processes. This lane owns budgets, not correctness rows.
- **Smoke** (`tests/smoke/*.integration.test.ts`) — spawned `vault-git` CLI subprocesses against a real remote, real SIGKILL. The most expensive lane; nightly, release, and activation qualification retain its exhaustive phase/stress proof. `mkSmokeFixture` (`tests/smoke/fixture.ts`) owns setup, ref snapshots, and exact PID/process-identity cleanup.

## The seam rule

Prove each claim at the lowest layer that honestly reaches it. A generated command string or a fake's canned stdout never stands in for a real git effect, a real process exit, or real trust evidence. When a boundary is faked, the test proves ordering and classification logic — not that the fake matches reality. Name that gap; do not let a green unit stand in for an unobserved real boundary.

## Durable state via an independent reader

Assert persisted state through a reader that did not write it, never the writer's return value. The house move: construct a fresh `createReceiptStore({ stateRoot, repositoryIdentity })` (or a fresh engine/doctor on the same `root`) and read through it.

- Engine recovery: `tests/engine-lifecycle.test.ts` — a fresh store+engine on the interrupted `fixture.root` re-reads the receipt.
- Remote at-most-one-owner: `tests/remote-ledger.test.ts` reads the winner straight off the bare remote with raw `git ls-remote`, bypassing both engines.
- Smoke: `RefSnapshot.remoteRefs` (`for-each-ref` dump) is the independent remote oracle; a stray ref fails the comparison.

## Crash injection wraps the real durability port

Recovery tests interrupt at a named point and prove the receipt survives. Two mechanisms:

- **Engine/runtime** — `FakeRuntime(interruptAt)` throws `interrupt:<point>` at the matching production `runtime.interrupt(...)` call. Points live in `src/engine.ts` (`before_remote_cas`, `after_remote_cas`, `after_local_commit`, `after_release_publication`, …). Interruption is pre-operation.
- **Store durability** — `tests/task-store.test.ts` wraps the *real* `createNodeVaultGitDurabilityPort` and interrupts before a chosen syscall index, so crash-at-each-phase runs against real fsync/link, not a fake.

Inject on both sides of every boundary where duplicate or lost work is possible — claim, launch, checkpoint, terminal write.

## Recovery re-drives through doctor, then repair

`complete()` refuses any phase that is not `writing`/`committing`. Recovery from a `push_pending` receipt does **not** call `complete()` again — it goes `doctor(...) → repair(...)`. The adopt-vs-republish split is driven by `receipt.ledgerReleaseId`:

- crash before the atomic close → `ledgerReleaseId` null → doctor routes `retry-push` → one publish.
- crash after the close, before the terminal receipt → `ledgerReleaseId` set → doctor routes `close-verified` → adopts the published release, **no second `atomicClose`**.

When a recovery test needs the `push_pending` doctor branch, the fakes must also supply `remote.reconcileAtomicClose` and `repository.inspectLocalCommit` — the base engine fakes omit them, and without them doctor returns `receipt_corrupt`. Extend them locally (per-test `Object.assign`), leaving the shared fakes untouched.

## Negative controls prove the test can go RED

A guard is only proven if a disposable perturbation makes its owning test fail. Two forms here:

- **In-file** — for a single guard, satisfy every other clause so the flipped one is the sole variable (a compound `||` guard passes on any clause). Assert the refusal, then confirm removing the production clause flips the assertion. Restore production byte-for-byte; a test-only change leaves `git diff src/*.ts` empty.
- **Recompile-and-run harness** — `tests/background-worker-negative-controls.integration.test.ts` copies src+tests to a temp root, asserts the baseline passes, applies one source mutation, and requires the literal `(fail)` in the owning test's output. This proves a real assertion failed, not a compile error.

Domain guards worth a negative control, by form:

- Recompile-and-run harness (`tests/background-worker-negative-controls.integration.test.ts`): worker-uniqueness, revision-CAS, the launch-generation / stale-generation fence, and terminal-refinement (`closed` absorbs).
- In-file controls: at-most-one-owner `priorWriterStopped` in `tests/repair.integration.test.ts`, and Doctor's never-its-own-continuation invariant (`nextAction.id !== "run_doctor"`) in `tests/doctor.test.ts`.

## Running tests

`bun test` is not run directly. Use dotfiles' native Test Runner with JSON output:

- From `.agents/skills/test-runner`, use `bun run test-runner run --mode compact --format json --cwd <dotfiles-root> -- <file> [-t <name>]` for one file.
- The smoke lane sets `setDefaultTimeout(180_000)` and spawns real subprocesses, so it can exceed the runner default. Run smoke files (or a `-t` phase filter) through that same native runner with `--timeout-ms 240000`; it honors the in-file timeout.
- `package.json` owns the script surface. `test:pr` runs exact detached-worker cleanup, the bounded five-row public manifest, then performance. `test:live-acceptance` verifies the exact owner manifest before running all five workflows. `test:smoke` retains the full crash/stress lane. `test` composes every qualification lane while replacement ownership is being hosted and proven. Read exact commands there rather than trusting a copy.

The hosted PR gate does not claim exhaustive phase coverage. Deterministic engine/store crash matrices stay in default correctness; full real-SIGKILL phase coverage runs nightly and through manual release or activation qualification. Keep the slower rows until their replacement owner is green on a hosted PR head.

## What the suite does not prove

Live SSH transport over the constructed `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`; known-hosts content trust (only metadata is bound); hosted macOS behavior until an exact PR head runs; installed activation; daily-driver soak. State these as unproved boundaries rather than letting a lower-layer green imply them.
