// Admission verification against the code-owned manifest (U02).
//
// This module owns two things ADR 0027 requires: the code-owned admission
// manifest (the trusted baseline of per-target identity, custody, lifetime, and
// entitlements) and the verification that decides whether an observed claim
// matches that baseline. Browser Use admits one product version while verifying
// every target independently, so verification is per-target and any drift —
// replaced binary, re-signed identity, removed target, widened custody, skewed
// version, unsupported schema, or an unminted placeholder — fails closed.
//
// Pure TypeScript: no Swift, no signing, no secret bytes. The error-code union
// is compile-time-exhaustive (`satisfies Record<AdmissionErrorCode, string>`)
// so a new admission reason cannot silently degrade into an untyped string.

 * The closed set of reasons a target claim can fail admission.

 * annotation forces exhaustiveness at compile time: adding a member here without
 * an entry there is a type error, so a new admission reason can never silently
 * degrade into an untyped fallthrough.
 *
 * - `unknown-target` — the claim names an id outside the three ADR-0027 targets
 *   (a removed or ghost target).
 * - `schema-version-unsupported` — the manifest's schema version is not the one
 *   this code pins (a stale claim against an older/newer shape).
 * - `product-version-skew` — the claim's product version differs from the
 *   admitted product version.
 * - `placeholder-bundle-id` — the manifest entry or the claim still carries the
 *   unminted placeholder sentinel in any signing string (bundle id, team
 *   identifier, or designated requirement).
 * - `bundle-id-mismatch` — the claimed bundle id is not the manifest's (a
 *   replaced/different signed binary).
 * - `team-identifier-mismatch` — the claimed signing team differs (re-signed
 *   under a foreign identity).
 * - `designated-requirement-mismatch` — the claimed code-signing designated
 *   requirement differs (same bundle id, re-signed).
 * - `entitlements-widened` — the claim grants custody the baseline withholds
 *   (custody union forbidden by ADR 0027).
 * - `lifetime-changed` — the claim runs a posture the baseline forbids (for
 *   example a daemon where only on-demand is admissible).
 * - `custody-changed` — the claimed custody root differs from the baseline.
