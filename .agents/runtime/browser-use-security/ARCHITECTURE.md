# Browser Use Security Architecture

Package architecture for `@side-quest/browser-use-security`.

## Shape

`browser-use-security` is the native product owner chartered by ADR 0027:
Browser Use Security ships as one signed, notarized macOS product containing
three separately signed executable targets — Approval Broker, Token Retrieval
Launcher, and Confidential Field Delivery XPC. This package owns the code-side
model of that product — per-target identity, the code-owned admission manifest,
and the drift proof — and hosts the unsigned native target sources
(`BrowserUseSecurity.xcodeproj/`, `targets/`, `entitlements/`) under this owner
directory per ADR 0027. Secret bytes never transit this package's TypeScript
layer; token bytes are handled only inside the signed Token Retrieval Launcher,
which hands them straight to the disposable `op` child. The native sources are
pre-staged unsigned; signing and notarization stay operator-gated behind the
ADR 0028 entry gate (full Xcode plus paid Apple Developer Program enrollment).

ADR 0028 splits the pure contract (in `skills/browser-use/src/`) from this
signed native capability. Absence of the native product is a legal, tested
state — `native-capability-absent` — expressed through typed verdicts, never a
crash or a stub. `src/model.ts` `TARGET_BUNDLE_IDS` is minted — it carries the
real `com.side-quest.browser-use-security.*` strings mirrored by each Xcode
target. `CODE_OWNED_ADMISSION_MANIFEST` intentionally stays placeholder-backed:
its per-target entries keep the `BUNDLE_ID_PLACEHOLDER` sentinel, so
`isMintedBundleId` rejects them and admission stays fail-closed until a signed
install presents a minted claim.

The Module Map below is the single per-module owner list. `AGENTS.md` and
`README.md` point here instead of repeating it; `tests/docs-drift.test.ts`
keeps the map complete in both directions.

## Maintainer Surfaces

- `AGENTS.md`: maintainer route, intent gate, change recipes, doc drift gate.
- `README.md`: human front door and product overview.
- `CONTEXT.md`: package language for target, admission, and capability posture.
- `tests/docs-drift.test.ts`: Module Map drift gate plus maintainer doc-set
  presence check.

## Module Map

- `package.json`: exports (`.` and `./cli`), `test` and `typecheck` scripts.
  No `bin` and no `sideQuest.sourceLinkedBin` yet — a later unit mints the CLI
  front door via `cli-author`.
- `scripts/install-binding-selection-capability.ts`: operator-gated local
  assembly and recoverable install for the Release Approval Broker plus its
  nested, separately signed environment-auth supervisor. It reuses the current
  admitted provisioning profile and retains the prior app before cutover.
- `src/model.ts`: the three target ids, the branded `BundleId` type with its
  `PLACEHOLDER` sentinel and admission guard (`isMintedBundleId`), per-target
  placeholder bundle ids, the admission-manifest schema types with per-target
  entitlements summary, lifetime, and custody (`TargetEntitlementsSummary`,
  `TargetLifetime`, `TargetCustody`, `TargetAdmissionEntry`,
  `AdmissionManifest`), and the closed `AdmissionVerdict` union including
  `native-capability-absent`.
- `src/admission.ts`: the code-owned admission manifest
  (`CODE_OWNED_ADMISSION_MANIFEST`), the ADR-0027 custody baseline, the
  compile-time-exhaustive `AdmissionErrorCode` union with its
  `satisfies Record<…>` reason map (`ADMISSION_ERROR_CODES`), per-target
  verification (`admitTarget`), and the minted-manifest builder
  (`buildAdmittedManifest`). Any drift — replaced, resigned, removed,
  entitlement-widened, or version-skewed target — fails closed with a typed code.
- `src/binding-selection-capability.ts`: fixed-install admission for the
  descriptor-private binding-selection capability. It verifies the signed
  Approval Broker app, its nested signed environment-auth supervisor, and the
  owner-only pinned public verifier before returning executable handles.
- `src/runtime.ts`: the injectable admission-runtime seam (`AdmissionRuntime`).
  `createNativeAbsentRuntime` is the prod placeholder returning the typed
  `native-capability-absent` verdict until the signed product exists;
  `createInMemoryAdmissionRuntime` is the earned in-memory fake that matches the
  prod output shape exactly (compact/pretty JSON parity).
- `src/cli.ts`: the `./cli` subpath export. Owns the in-process
  `main(argv, deps)` consumption seam that drives the injected admission runtime
  (`verify` command + bare posture), plus the fail-closed
  `native-capability-absent` scalar posture (`cliPlaceholderVerdict`). A later
  unit replaces the surface with the facade-backed command CLI.
- `src/index.ts`: re-exports the package seam (`src/admission.ts`,
  `src/binding-selection-capability.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, `src/model.ts`,
  `src/runtime.ts`).
- `tests/docs-drift.test.ts`: proves `src` modules and this Module Map agree in
  both directions and the maintainer doc set is complete.
- `tests/admission.test.ts`: proves manifest drift (replace/resign/remove/widen/
  version-skew/stale/placeholder) invalidates admission with the right code.
- `tests/binding-selection-capability.test.ts`: proves the fixed local picker
  capability admits only a safe signed layout, exact entitlements and version,
  nested supervisor identity, and matching owner-only verifier pin.
- `tests/runtime.test.ts`: proves the prod and in-memory adapters share the
  `native-capability-absent` output shape byte-for-byte and drive `main`.

## Boundaries

- No `SecurityPolicy` registry: the three targets are a closed, fixed set
  (ADR 0027). There is no external extension boundary; a fourth target requires
  a new decision, not a registry entry.
- No secret bytes cross TypeScript, argv, env, output, adapter, daemon, or
  durable state. This package models identity and admission evidence only.
- Every admission path is fail-closed: a placeholder bundle id is never
  admitted, and an absent native product yields `native-capability-absent`.
