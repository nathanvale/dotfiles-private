# browser-use-security

`browser-use-security` is the native product owner for Browser Use Security:
one signed, notarized macOS product containing three separately signed
executable targets (ADR 0027). It owns the code-side model of that product —
per-target identity, a code-owned admission manifest, and drift proof — so
Browser Use can admit one product version while verifying every target
independently.

The `src/` model is pure TypeScript: it signs nothing and holds no secret
bytes. The unsigned native target sources (`BrowserUseSecurity.xcodeproj/`,
`targets/`, `entitlements/`) are authored alongside it; they carry no secret
bytes. An admitted local development install still requires full Xcode, a
valid Apple Development identity, and a compatible embedded provisioning
profile (ADR 0028 entry gate).

## The Three Targets

| Target | Role | Never receives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approval Broker | Touch ID-backed presence | OP token, raw credential, browser channel |
| Token Retrieval Launcher | App-like bundle embedding a provisioning profile | browser channel |
| Confidential Field Delivery XPC | Delivers confidential fields | OP token, network entitlement |

Packaging never unions privilege or secret custody across targets.

## Capability Posture

ADR 0028 splits the pure contract (`skills/browser-use/src/`) from this signed
native capability. The native product may be entirely absent — that is a legal,
tested state, `native-capability-absent`, expressed through typed verdicts, not
a crash or a stub.

Notarized production distribution remains unavailable. The operator-gated
`install:binding-selection-local` script can build, sign, verify, and atomically
install the Approval Broker plus its nested environment-auth supervisor for
local development. Admission rejects an invalid version, signature, target,
entitlement set, or embedded supervisor. This local lane makes no Developer ID
or notarization acceptance claim.

Bundle ids are minted: `src/model.ts` `TARGET_BUNDLE_IDS` carries the real
`com.side-quest.browser-use-security.*` strings, mirroring each Xcode target's
`PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` and `Info.plist` `CFBundleIdentifier`. The
code-owned admission manifest still ships the `BUNDLE_ID_PLACEHOLDER` sentinel,
so admission stays fail-closed until a signed install presents a minted claim.
