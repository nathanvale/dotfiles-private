//
// An app-like bundle embedding a provisioning profile so it can hold the
// restricted private data-protection keychain access group. It reads EXACTLY
// one keychain item (the Browser Automation service-account token, stored
// AfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly and non-synchronizing) and immediately execs
// the disposable official `op` helper with an exact environment carrying that
// one token variable, inherit:false. It receives NO browser channel.
//
// The token never enters Browser Use's parent environment, with-env, .env,
// tmux, a persistent PTY, shell history, an adapter, a plugin, a daemon, or the
// delivery helper's environment (R7). It exists only inside the disposable op
// child's environment for the lifetime of that one exec.
//
// Authored unsigned. The restricted keychain-access-group requires the embedded
// provisioning profile from a paid Apple Developer Program enrollment (ADR
// 0028), so this does not build or run without full Xcode plus enrollment.
